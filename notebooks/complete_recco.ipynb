The crag is not over-bolted. The NW-facing cliff is shady. The generally solid, \"granite-ish\" rock is somewhat slabby with a few roof bands adding excitement to most of the routes. Most of the climbing is on small flakes and blocks that protrude from the underlying rock. Some of these blocks especially in the roof bands are not securely attached, and testing your holds is recommended. I have managed to pull small rocks and flakes off of most of the routes on the cliff. This should clean up with time and traffic, but as of August 2012, belaying out of the line of fire and a helmet for the belayer are good ideas. For the most part, the rock is solid and fun to climb on but testing holds is highly recommended (especially in the roof bands).

       " 'Started out and scoped out by locals T4 and Peter, I joined in the fun for helping to wrap it up. As with other Royal routes, the pitch count and length can be either viewed as somewhat exaggerated or limited. It depends on your viewpoint. As Tim and Peter like to frequent these routes with people with less experience and stay within vocal and visual contact as much as possible, a belay is often available at the ledges before continuing.  Other climbers will inevitably choose to link pitches and therefore report a much smaller number of climbing pitches.   Loose rock, lichen, and moss still exists, and though less consistent quality climbing may be available as for Royal Flush or  Royal Rocklette Ar\\xc3\\xaate, some outstanding pitches are to be found on Crown Royal.   Just after the bike path sign, duck in to the woods on a well worn trail. Follow it for about 30m passing a piece of cord around a tree (if it is still there!), and then turn right and parallel the bike path onto no real obvious trail until reaching a prominent blobby formation of slab. A few more \"markers\" may be visible assisting in locating the beginning of the route. The first bolt may be visible about 10m up from the start.

Pitch #2: Climb to a roof, clip a bolt and trend up passing a few bolts and right to a slab and \"wasserrinne\" easily avoiding a loose looking, yet appealing flake on the right to a two-bolt belay. 5.7, 20m.  Pitch #3: \"The coffee table pitch\". Continue up and right up thin slab finally traversing past a dead snag and up to a two-bolt belay. 5.8, 20m.  Pitch #4: Climb a short easy and fun, but still dirty slab passing a bolt and fixed piton to a ledge. Walk up further and belay off one of the massive trees. 5.5, 20m.  Pitch #5: Continue up excellent rock passing some fixed protection towards a prominent ar\\xc3\\xaate and belay in a gully and two-bolt belay. 5.9, 15m.

       " 'Excellent approach and descent info is here: Mount Royal (near Frisco)  This is a 5.8 climb put up by a 5.13 climber for 5.8 leaders. This route is so much fun, I know I will be driving back all the way from Utah to do it again soon. Thanks to the hard work of Texas Tower Tim Toula, the climbers of Frisco have their own little \"Big Wall\" that is intelligently protected, with harder variation pitches available for those seeking more challenging climbing, with excellent pitch after pitch of outstanding climbing.   MANY OF THE 15-30m PITCHES MAY BE LINKED OR SIMUL-CLIMBED. The stated number of roped pitches is for clarity, ease of route finding, and ease of partner communication. With that said, when linking pitches, verbal and/or visual communication may be seriously impaired or impossible due to the wandering nature of the route as well as incessantly loud noise pollution from busy I-70. The route offers super fun cruising with memorable movement.   All belays are bolted. Please leave the rappel links and/or carabiners left at the stations for those who need to rappel the route. Many people new to multi-pitch climbs may choose to only climb the lower wall and these stations have been bootyed and re-equipped already numerous times since initially equipping the route. Although first thought to be intended for those new to this type of climbing, popularity has soared raising the number of ascents (as of Nov 2012) to more than 600!    At almost the lowest point or toe of the granite at the base of the climb (7-10 minutes approach time from the car), a nice rope up ledge will be found. Up and right is the start to Royal Rocklette Arete.     [Editor\\'s Note: This was originally submitted as a 20 pitch route, but I doubt anyone has ever done it in that many.  With a 60m, it is easy to do in 6-8 roped pitches, plus some unroped walking.  Judging from comments and my own experience, that is the norm, so I have changed the official pitch count to 8.  See comments for common ways to link pitches.  My preference: P1-3: combine #1-12 below with some walking easy.  There are so many anchors, just pick one when you think you\\'re running out of rope. P4: combine #13-14 below P5: combine #15-16 below P6: combine #17-20 below -Nick Wilder]  Pitch #1: Climb up the middle of the slab past a couple of bolts passing few obstacles to a two-bolt belay platform. 5.4, 20m.  Pitch #2: Follow a black streak straight up to another two-bolt belay. 5.5, 15m.  Pitch #3: Pass an overlap protected by a bolt and some natural protection opportunities to a two-bolt belay. 5.6, ~15m.  Pitch #4: Lead up and right passing 4 -5 bolts. Four different  variations are available for this pitch alone, which may lead to some confusion, but trend right for the  ongoing pitches. 5.6, 15m.   Pitch #5: Choose 5.10 out slightly left or 5.6 angling right and up a groove to a White Crystal rock spur to one of 2 two bolt belays. 5.6, 20m.  Pitch #6: Traverse right (or down & right from the 5.10 var on P #5) on a narrow ledge to a tree and then to the base of a white crystal dike. 4th class, 30m.  Pitch #7: Climb the White Crystal Groove either going through Joe\\'s 5.10 mantle variation straight up or start down & right and go to a two bolt belay. 5.7, 30m.  Pitch #8: Climb past 3 bolts (1st may be hard to spot) up a rib to a belay at two-bolts. At the belay is a plaque in memory of our mutual friend, Swiss Mountain Guide Res von K\\xc3\\xa4nel, who died in the Alps during the same time while Tim was doing the FA. Royal Flush is similar to many long \"Plaisir\" climbs in Switzerland. 5.7, 30m.  Pitch #9: Third class (exposed) up and then mostly 2nd class left traversing past 2 small, grungier buttresses. Follow cairns/faint trail, 60+ m.  Pitch #10: The White Rib Pitch. Joe\\'s Cracks are nice offerings to the left (5.6) or pass 3 bolts on a slabby pillar (5.7) and belay near a snag. 30m.  Pitch #11: Go straight up (5.10) or out right up the Grey Beard Slab past a roof and more slab to a two-bolt belay. 5.6, 30m.  Pitch #12: Follow cairns up scree to the base of the apron of the Headwall. 3rd class, ~150m.  Look for the bolt line just to the right of a large pine at the base of the Apron.  Pitch #13: Climb a classic pitch up a white streak with memorable holds past 1 pin & 5 bolts. 5.7, 30m.  Pitch #14:  Continue past 3 more bolts & cross the gully at the top of the Apron moving left of the prominent cleft dihedral system of Mount Royal to the \"Headwall\" past 2 bolts to one of 2 two bolt belays. Use the left anchor for the 5.9 version of P15.  This anchor is hidden until you walk to the left on a 1 foot ledge system. 5.7, 20m.  Pitch #15: Continue straight up (5.10) from right anchor or from the left anchor to a tricky 5.9 system of steep grooves. These merge after 5 bolts.  Interesting moves to a two-bolt belay. 5.9, ~18m.

Pitch #17: Climb up to the Grey Shelf past a few bolts. Some small Camalots may be useful here. 5.8, ~18m.  Pitch #18: Climb through some blocky roofs with funky rock past a ledge and a two-bolt belay near a tree. A wall register is found here...spray away. 5.8, ~18m.  Pitch #19: Follow up a coarse, dirt-filled gully slinging pine trees for protection. Beware of some loose rock. Two bolt belay. Exposed 3rd class, 30m.  Pitch #20: Surmount loose blocks to the summit and a sign that asks hikers not to throw rocks due to climbers below. 3rd class, 10m.   Though descent via rappel is always an option if inclement weather strikes, from the top, walking off to the south on a great trail which drops down to the town of Frisco is best.  Stay south, going down a bit, and then back up a hill for a total of 1/4 mile until turning left and walking downhill. If you\\'re not on a major trail, you probably tried to head downhill too early.  30-45 minutes.',\n",

It is only 1/4 mile away from the popular White Cliff and is soon to be a similar, popular destination.  I have divided the wall into 3 areas, West, Central, and East walls.

       " \"Blanca Peak, 14,345 feet, is located in the Sierra Blanca group of the Sangre de Cristo Range.  The view of the Sierra Blanca's from the San Luis Valley is very dramatic.  They rise over 6000 vertical feet from the valley floor.  From an alpinist's point of view, the north face of Blanca Peak should be of great interest.  Rising steeply for over 2000 feet, it is one of the only true Nordwands of Colorado.  The Orme's Buttress Route, put up in 1927 by Robert Ormes, is the classic line on the north face.  The climbing on the north face is primarily granite with the occasional bit of quartzite thrown in for good measure.  The rock quality is somewhat loose, but very climbable nonetheless.  A myriad of lines is possible.  Blanca Peak also offers a host of moderate scrambling routes.  The north face is accessed from the Lilly Lake trailhead located in the Huerfano [River]drainage on the east side of the range.  The approach up the valley beside the Huerfano River is one of the prettiest in Colorado.  Interesting junk leftover from mining operations makes for some entertainment on the approach.  Most of the scrambling routes start from the Como Lake trailhead on the west side of the range from the San Luis Valley.  An ascent of Blanca Peak from the Lilly Lake trailhead is best descended with a traverse over Ellingwood Peak and then back down its north ridge.  From the west, Blanca Peak is easily descended by the northwest face and north ridge route back to the Como Lake trailhead.  Both Roach and Dawson have good information available about Blanca Peak in their guides.  Enjoy.  This is very cool peak.\",\n",
       " 'As Gerry Roach writes in \"Colorado\\'s Fourteeners: From Hikes to Climbs,\" \"Simply put, this is Colorado\\'s most astonishing connecting ridge.\"  The mile-long ridge between Little Bear Peak and Blanca Peak is beautiful and awe inspiring.  Anyone attempting it should probably consult a real guidebook for details.  My purpose in listing it here is to make a few notes (rather than provide a detailed route description) and to open this up for comments.  Both Gerry Roach and Louis Dawson\\'s guides provide excellent, thorough route descriptions.  However, route finding on this ridge is very easy: simply put, you just don\\'t have that many options.  For 95 percent of the climb you stay on the very apex of the ridge.  Exceptions being skirting the \"Captain Bivwacko Tower\" to the left (looks hard but only requires one highly exposed move) and then later skirting Point 13,860 to the right (this obvious roadblock comes shortly after the Little Bear/Blanca saddle and is a vertical wall that blocks the way) by descending slightly, cutting across some talus, and then immediately heading back up to the ridge crest again.  The climbing is very exposed almost the entire way and there is almost no relief from this so be prepared.  Generally the whole ridge is 3rd-4th class with a few sections of harder 4th class bordering on easy 5th class (approach shoes should be sufficient).  There are no sustained sections on the climb and you can rest wherever you want. However, the true crux may be in maintaining a high level of concentration for a mile of dangerous climbing.  Rock quality is usually very good but test your holds.  The ridge can be windy.  Guidebooks suggest doing the traverse from Little Bear to Blanca.  I believe the traverse could be done in the other direction without adding difficulty, however the traverse would be significantly more tedious in this direction.  Also, apparently typical times range from 2-8 hours for the traverse.  We moved at a very casual pace and took frequent breaks and still finished in 2 1/2 hours.  I can\\'t imagine a time of more than 4 hours to be \"typical.\"  Good luck if you decide to tackle this!  The route is truly awesome and a whole lot of fun!',\n",
       " \"The Ormes Buttress is a superb line up a huge north face in an awesome setting.  Legend has it that Robert Ormes climbed the route in 1927 in response to Ellingwood climbing the Crestone Needle.  The Ormes Buttress is much more sustained than the Ellingwood Ledges on the Crestone Needle.  Basically, it starts as soon as you leave the ground and doesn't let up except for a brief period of scrambling on the upper third of the route.  The rock is weathered granite, loose in some places, but tolerable overall.  Use the Lilly Lake trailhead as an approach.  The best way to access the route is to follow the Lilly Lake Trail to 11,600 feet where a switchback starts to take you away from the face, back toward Lilly Lake.  At this point, if you are observant, an old mining road takes off across the meadows and talus to some old boilers located beneath the lowest cliffs on the north face.  Follow this road or work your way however out onto the talus beneath the north face.  Your goal is to break through a low band of cliffs and gain the lowest point of the north face.  A permanent snowfield will be on the left of the buttress.    If you choose to stay with the Huerfano River as an approach, be prepared for numerous, feet soaking, creek crossings.  It looks like it would make sense to follow the river, but trust me, stay with the Lilly Lake Trail, and follow the signs.  Dry feet are happy feet.  Once at or near the lowest point in the north face, scramble across a slab to a low angled arete.  Climb the arete to a ledge.  If you are on route, you should pass some old pitons that look like a belay anchor.  These are perhaps original pitons left on the route.  Above traverse back to the left and look for a way to break through to the next ledge.  Follow this same theme, looking for weaknesses, dodging left or right when necessary, to gain ground in your battle up the face.  A final headwall, about halfway up the buttress, will be bordered by a right facing dihedral.  If the dihedral is running with water, face climb on solid holds to the right of the dihedral.  Traverse back into the dihedral at its top and crank some layback moves to reach easier ground. Above, easier scrambling leads to the top of the face near where the ridge that connects Blanca Peak to Ellingwood Peak joins the summit of Blanca Peak.  The climbing still has a move or two here and there.  So, be prepared for a long day of climbing if you are going to pitch every bit of it.  Simul climbing would be better for the upper part of this route.  For a comparison, the upper part of this route is slightly harder and more sustained than the upper part of Kieners route on Long's Peak.Once on the ridge, turn left and a few steps will take you to the summit.    For a descent, follow the ridge to its right or northwest to the summit of Ellingwood Peak.  It looks like it will be painful and tedious, as there is some elevation loss and gain to get to the top of Ellingwood Peak from Blanca Peak.  With judicious route finding, it is possible to stay mostly with the ridgeline and avoid too much elevation loss.  A rappel is possible from midway along the ridge that will allow access to the lower angled north face of Ellingwood Peak.  This is a possibility, but will need to be negotiated carefully to avoid being cliffed out in a sea of loose rock.    The better alternative is to descend the north ridge of Ellingwood Peak.  Use a compass to locate the north ridge from the summit of Ellingwood Peak.  Follow the north ridge from the summit of Ellingwood Peak to a gap in the ridge at 13,200 feet.  From the gap, descend down to the right or east.  Look for the path of least resistance.  Eventually, cliffs will force you to go even further to the right or east to find a low angled traverse that leads back to the talus slopes beneath the cliff band along the bottom of the north face of Ellingwood Peak.  Follow grassy slopes down through another cliff band and finally across talus to the Lilly Lake Trail.  Use the mining road as a reference to find the Lilly Lake Trail when descending to it.  This is a big route, covering lots of terrain and involves lots of elevation gain and loss in a remote setting.  Be prepared and take the weather into account.  There is no easy exit to the Huerfano River drainage from Blanca Peak.  That is why you get the bonus of scoring 2 peaks in 1 day!  Enjoy.  \",\n",

       " \"Capitol Peak is one of the most challenging fourteeners in Colorado, and yields some good technical routes including the Northwest Ridge. Standing at 14,130', it is one of the most impressive mountains in the Elk Range with its amazing north face. Unlike some of the other mountains in the Elk Range, Capitol has very solid rock which can make the climbing very enjoyable, and the views from the summit are very rewarding and spectacular. \",\n",
       " 'This is the roughly 2.5-mile-long ridge that connects the Elk Range\\'s two granite Fourteeners, Capitol and Snowmass. It\\'s far and away the hardest 14er-connecting ridge in Colorado, and likely one of the hardest ridges in the state, for a variety of reasons -- length, exposure, route-finding, loose rock (extremely loose rock, almost the whole way).  To do this as a loop trip, park at the Snowmass Creek trailhead. (From the town of Snowmass on CO Hwy 82 drive south 1.7 miles to a T-junction. Turn left. Drive about 10.7 miles -- the road turns to dirt around 7 miles -- over a bridge spanning Snowmass Creek to another T-junction. Turn right and drive to the Snomass Creek Trailhead at the road\\'s end.) Now climb Capitol via the Knife Edge (NE Ridge), approaching from West Snowmass Creek (go 1.7 miles up the Snomass Creek Trail to the West Snowmass Creek fork on the right, which is signed; head up this trail a good three-four steep miles until you can contour along the east side of Mount Daly, near then at timberline, into the basin northeast of K2 that contains Moon Lake -- this is a good place to fill water bottles).  From the summit of Capitol, descend SW along the knife-edge (loose, exposed) until you can downclimb due south into a bowl (some 5.7ish stuff, exposed). Continue south just west of the ridgeline on good, solid slabs, which lull you into thinking that the rest of the ridge will be bomber (it ain\\'t). As soon as the slabs end, negotiate a series of gendarmes, invariably dropping west when the ridge itself either becomes too loose or impassable. This may involve 4th and 5th class downclimbing, depending on how far you drop off the ridge, and where. Continue this way for a long way, on terrain that is so sustained in its looseness as to be psychologically wearing. (I accidentally trundled some big stuff -- not onto myself -- it works best to keep your limbs as spread out as possible onto different blocks in case one goes. They all shift.) It also seemed best to stay right on the ridgeline when possible, as this places you atop all the choss.  Along the way you\\'ll pass various notches that allow you to bail east into the Pierre Lake Cirque, from which you could drop back down to Snowmass Creek, and your car. You can also bail west at any point, but it would put you miles and miles from your car, with your best way out at that point being to negotiate a return northward to Capitol Creek.  Just before North Snowmass Mountain, after you\\'ve negotiated a prominent sub-peak, the ridge becomes an absolute nightmare, with car-sized teetering gendarms and huge scalloping flakes on the walls below them. Drop down west via a nasty downclimb (you could rappel, I think) to the talus below and walk south 50 yards until you\\'re beneath a huge, rotten overhanging bowl in the ridge. Climb up diagonalling ramp/cracks to the right of the bowl on the north-facing wall (5.5, very exposed) to gain a faint rib. Follow dirt, loose blocks, etc. back to the ridge proper, then a nice pitch of solid rock (5.5/5.6; pass an old piton) on white stone takes you straight up the ridge to the summit of North Snowmass.   The agony is over ... cruise over to the summit of Snowmass (3rd class), then descend via the East Face route to Snowmass Lake. An 8-mile walk out on the Snowmass Creek trail takes you back to the car.  If you do this with a partner, stay at least 50 feet apart at all times. A rope would be useful for the occasional rappel; luckily, most of the 5th class terrain is on solid rock, but this is still a big, albeit spectacular, chossheap in the sky. Tread lightly ...  HISTORY: The first ascent of the North Ridge of Snowmass (maybe the most technical bit of the traverse; this is where I found the pins) goes to Paul Petzold and a group of Outward Bound students he was leading on July 3 or 4, 1963, according to Gary Neptune, who was one of Petzold\\'s students that day. \"Petzold was the chief climbing instructor at Outward Bound then and led the climb for a group of the better climbing students. He let me lead the second rope,\" Neptune wrote in an email. \"There\\'s a photo in the store of our little group on the summit after that climb. Maybe that was the first ascent of the ridge. There were no pitons other than the ones Paul placed, and I didn\\'t remove any. I took a nice photo of the connecting ridge and thought that it might make a great traverse, but I never went back.\"  As for the FA of the integral ridge? Bill Forrest and Glen Denny set out, according to Forrest, with the goal to climb \"from the Outward Bound camp above Marble to the summit of South Maroon,  then climb Snowmass, then on to the summit of Capitol, and then return to  the O.B. camp - in less than 24 hours.\" Part of their monster day, then, was to traverse from Snowmass to Capitol and, says Forrest, \"we didn\\'t stay on the ridge all the  way when we traversed from Snowmass to Capitol. Staying on the \\'true ridge\\'  between Snowmass and Capitol was never part of the plan. We were pretty tired when we summited Snowmass. As I recall (and remember that was over 40 years ago), we were just below the ridge most of the way as we headed  west/northwest.  We had to gain the ridge to summit Capitol and  encountered a bit of 5th class as we climbed to the top of the ridge just S.  E. of Capitol\\'s summit.\"  So for now, I don\\'t know who made the FA going from Capitol to Snowmass or how closely that hove to the ridgecrest itself. One section, to me, looked so loose as to be impassable, but you never know...  Forrest and Denny\\'s accomplishment in 1966 is truly remarkable, a feat rarely if ever repeated, I\\'d imagine. Says Forrest, \"It was a long day in the hills. In short, we did the tour in under 24 hours, and my knees were badly damaged in the process. It was many years before I could walk without pain again.\"',\n",

Take the obvious crack/dihedral to a belay below the roof (5.10, 35 meters).   P2. Pitch two climbs up and right, following discontinuous cracks (5.9+, 30 meters).   P3. Pitch three goes right 15 feet from the belay to a crack. Follow the crack to a ledge (5.8, 30 meters).   P4. Pitch 4 traverses straight left along a horizontal crack, then turns up and climbs to the 4th class bowl below the Unicorn Spire (5.8, 30 meters).   P5.

From K2, descend down the ridge towards Capitol Peak.  This is where the fun starts.  You can decide if you want to use a rope on the Knife Edge ridge or not.

Traverse left for 30 feet to the beginning of an obvious crack system that leads to a chimney.  Fixed gear may be visible.  Pitch 1 - Climb a finger crack that ends with a traverse left to a roof.  Crank through the roof to gain a stance.  From the stance, clip the old fixed bolt, and climb into a crack system that begins almost horizontal and arches up and to the left.  This section is wide.  From the top of the crack, crank through another small roof to a stance.  Jam the off-finger crack (crux) above the stance to a belay of fixed slings beneath the chimney.  5.9.  Pitch 2 - Get into the chimney with a hard move and continue up to the end of the chimney on a slab.  Belay at an anchor of fixed slings.  Be careful of loose rock on this pitch.  5.8.  Pitch 3 through 5 - Scramble or simul-climb a low angled slab and gully system for 400 feet to the base of the Unicorn Spire.

The spires hold a number of quality moderate climbs on surprisingly good rock. There are also some steep splitter hand and finger cracks on the Grand Chimney just begging to get climbed. Adventure climbing at its finest!  Although the area has potential for several first ascents, the area has been seeing climbers since the '60s. Outward Bound has been putting students on top of the spires for over 40 years and has kept the area entirely pristine.

Don't get me wrong tho, a lot of the rock is pretty good. All the route needs is a good cleaning. The route climbs out of a chasm between the largest tower and Treasure Mountain, into a ramp, into a dihedral.  The belay ledge is on top of the dihedral. We had a 70m rope and had a bit extra to spare when we got to the belay. A 60m should make it but not a 50m. The gear the the belay isn't amazing. We ended up finding a couple pieces and slinging a chockstone. From here, the route continues up broken rock with nice, thin cracks, but a lot of this rock consists of huge, loose blocks, be careful here. There are actually two OLD pegs barely worth clipping, and then another, better peg just as you are about to crest the wall. Carefully construct a belay once you've made it to the top. There are looooooose rocks everywhere, and it takes lots of care not to knock rocks onto the second below you. Be extra careful of the rope running through the rocks.  We left an anchor to rappel off on the south side of the chimney. Two pitons and a tricam, equalized with green webbing and a locker. We rapped with a 70m, but a 60m tag line, and barely got to the bottom. Quite the rappel!\",\n",
       " \"The Citadel is a ranked 13'er located on the Continental Divide, north of the Eisenhower Tunnel. The peak has twin summits and is not officially named. The Citadel is close to to I-70, and typically accessed via the Herman Gulch trailhead, so the first bit of the approach can be somewhat crowded on the trail. However, once you reach the end of the trail and bushwhack towards the base of the mountain, the traffic diasappears and you have a lot of solitude.  Obtaining the summit will entail 3rd and 4th class climbing at the easiest. The elevation difference between the two summits is negligible. Most who summit the Citadel bag both peaks, and it's common to make the traverse to Pettingel for a challenging ridge scramble. While the standard route to the summits is class 3, the Citadel also offers the potential for technical, as well as snow climbing routes. Avalanche potential on the approach is high in the winter.\",\n",
       " \"After reaching Herman Lake, head WSW and follow the trail until it disappears near Herman Lake's outlet stream. Contour along the slopes and marshy areas towads the saddle which sits to the east of the Citadel.  After gaining this saddle at 12,400 feet, hike up the Citadel's east ridge. Once below the east summit block, the standard route traverses the cliffs to the WNW taking you to a steep, loose, class 3 gully which provides access to a saddle between the Citadel's two summits. From here, you can tackle the east and west summits. The 4th class crux of the east summit scramble is just above this saddle. Look for a dihedral in the rock which provides access up the cliff section that rises above the saddle. There are solid holds and exposure is minimal. Once above the crux the summit is a short scramble further. Retreat can be downclimbed or rappelled. To reach the west summit, scramble west from the saddle. This summit scramble has a bit more exposure.  A more challenging alternative with more exposure on the east summit is to take on the east summit directly from the ridge, without the WNW traverse to the saddle. The climb up the east summit from this side is more exposed 3rd/4th class.\",\n",

The best climbing season is from late June-September although there are some good snow/ice climbs also. There are several technical routes in the Crestone group including Ellingwood Ledges (part of Fifty Classic Climbs of North America) and the NW Pillar on the Peak.

Protecting this climb can be tricky - expecially on the crux 7th pitch.  The specifics:  Climb on the east face for approximately 6 pitches of up to 5.7 (with a 60m rope, you may be able to cut this down to 4 pitches).  For the crux pitch, ascend from a ledge up and to the left to climb a small overhang (poor pro).  Then do a rising traverse to the right (back to the edge).  2 or 3 more easier pitches will take you to the top of the pillar.  From here follow the North Buttress route to the summit of Crestone Peak.  Keep in mind that the knobs which makes this climb good are sometimes loose/brittle (we broke off two!), so a fall could happen at any time.  This route would be 2 or 3 stars if it wasn't for the occasionally bad knob and somewhat runout climbing.\",\n",

       " 'This is one of the \"Four Great 14er Traverses\". It is a fun route on good rock but is not as aesthetic as other traverses as you are rarely on the ridgecrest. As with all alpine climbs, be prepared for bad weather, start early, and expect tricky route-finding.    From the summit of Crestone Peak, descend to the saddle where the Northwest and South gullies meet at the ridge crest. Descend the South gully for approximately 500 feet, and find a path of small cairns leading left (~ Southeast?) across a series of grassy benches.  You can also exit the South Gully up higher, adding more difficult, but still fun terrain to your climb.   Traverse towards a prominent gully directly beneath the upper difficulties of Crestone Needle. When you reach the gully, ascend it on broken Class 3 terrain. Near the top, you will see a prominent tower known as the Black Gendarme. Cut hard right about 100 feet from the ridge crest and ascend a shallow dihedral/face system (difficult Class 3).   At this point, you can choose to climb a Class 3 face or go through a natural slot and traverse an airy ledge system. Both are fun and meet up in a wide class 3 gully with cool rock towers. Ascend this gully and make another slabby traverse under the intimidating summit pitch of Crestone Needle. Climb a ramp to a small ledge below the steep summit pitch.  This summit pitch is the route\\'s crux; a steep and airy 100 foot Class 4 headwall with great holds. It is the best pitch of Class 4 I\\'ve ever done, and it tops out just below the summit.  The traverse can also be done from Needle to Peak (and is done regularly), but I personally recommend Peak to Needle for the following reasons:  - If going from Needle to Peak, you either have to make a tricky downclimb of the crux or (more commonly) rappel. This decreases the enjoyment of the climb.  - The descent off of Crestone Needle is shorter than that off the Peak.  - The route finding is a little easier going from Peak to Needle.',\n",
       " \"Got up at 4:30am to get a good start on the climb.  We hiked up to the Upper South Colony Lake and then waited for a little light to start climbing.  The standard route ascends a 3rd class slab up to a ramp on the Needles' East face, then starts the 4th class arete.  There is also a direct start, which adds two pitches of 5.6 climbing up to the 3rd class ramp.  We ended up doing the direct direct start which started on the N side of the arete and added 6 pitches of 5.5/5.6 climbing up to the arete.  Once we got to the 4th class section, progress was faster, but we still stayed roped up which made it slow going.  The headwall section is the crux, which we did in 4 pitches.  The climbing here was really nice, and the last, crux pitch was 150 feet of 5.7 up a nice crack.  There was another group in front of us already on the standard 5.7 crack, so I took one to the right, which angled up and right for a bit, then went straight up to the belay.  It was about the same grade 5.7ish and offered nice hand and finger jams with cobbled conglomerate rock for extra hands and feet.  From here, it was about 200 feet of 3rd class to the summit.  Key beta for the climb:  We did 10 technical pitches (although easy) that take time nonetheless.  Plan on using a WHOLE day for this climb.  You start at first light to make it off the mountain before thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Since we did it in September, the storm factor was less, but still present.  Even so, we didn't make it back to camp until about 4pm.  Take plenty of water, extra food and clothing, and definitely first aid gear.\",\n",

The climb starts with a hard to protect, 5.8 move up a bulge with a few loose blocks.  After that, the route finding and climbing is easy - just stay on the Prow.

The best option is to continue straight up for another low 5th class pitch to the summit of Kit Carson.  Keep in mind that protection can be hard to find.  For the descent, head east for about a mile (climbing over another peak) to a broad valley (lowpoint between Kit Carson and Ellingwood) that will allow you to return back to your camp.

The traverse encompasses 9 named towers, from South to North: Cancer, Capricorn, the Gemini Twins, Taurus, Scorpio, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aries.   While the traverse only encompasses the Zodiacs, which can be accessed from either basin to the East or West, some may argue a ridge traverse begins and end with a summit. Red Mtn. B serves as a good start to the South and either Mt. Silverthorne (aka Willow Benchmark) or East Thorne serves as a good end. I personally like the idea of ending with Zodiac View as it is aptly named.  The downside to adding Red is that it tacks on a half mile of class 2 talus. Have fun with that.  Climb Cancer\\'s south face at class 4 max. Downclimb the northern side for a bit until reaching a cliff. Rappel 60 feet (webbing around boulder) off the east side to a ledge.

Scramble up the twin summits of South Gemini Twin at class 3/4. To downclimb, utilize canyoneering technique and drop the North chimney between the sub summits. Or rap up to 50 feet.  Scramble up a gully on North Gemini Twin, and turn left to find a clean 15 foot dihedral on the N side. It goes at perhaps 5.easy to the summit. Scamper up and down.  Taurus\\' face is intimidating at first, but it goes at class 4. The somewhat junky 80 foot rappel to the north might be downclimbable.  Scramble up the East side of Scorpio, and curl around to the North face. Climb the NW aspect, and hook a left to the summit (5.6, 30 feet plus 15 feet of easier), rappel down.  Scramble up and over Libra, walk the knife edge, and climb the mini-tower \"Libra Prime\" (5.0, loose blocks) or bypass it on the right.  Class 2-3 up Sagittarius, rappel 40 feet north.

       " 'Located in the Arapaho and the Roosevelt National Forests in Colorado, the Indian Peaks Wilderness area was added to the National Wilderness Preservation System by Congress in 1978. The name was selected because many of the peaks within the wilderness are named for Native American tribes of the west. This wilderness area covers nearly 75,000 acres, following the Continental Divide south for nearly 16 miles, with the Rocky Mountain National Park as its northern border.   Indian Peaks contains vast areas of alpine tundra, numerous cirque basins with remnant glaciers, and nearly 50 lakes. Streams in the wilderness include Middle and South St. Vrain, Boulder, Buchanan, Cascade, and Arapaho Creeks. Elevations range from 8,400 to over 13,000 feet. The underlying rock of the Indian Peaks area is 80-90% Precambrian biotite gneiss formed approximately 1800 million years ago. The area has since been reshaped by at least six glacial sequences dating back 15,000 years.   Within Indian Peaks lie N Arapahoe Peak  (13,502 ft), Apache Peak (13,438 ft.), Navajo Peak (13,405 ft*.), S. Arapahoe Peak (13,397), Ogalalla Peak (13,333 ft.), Mt.

Gerry Roach refers to these towers as the Chessmen, but in his guidebook he says he knows of no recorded climbs on them.  The Chessmen have dwelt in obscurity for years.    For better or worse, the Chessmen are now known and climbed.  The Kasparov Traverse is a journey from Shoshoni Peak to Apache Peak along this scenic ridge, climbing all of the Chessmen on the way.  The towers are climbed in this order (see overview picture):  White Knight, Knight's Pawn, The Queen, The Bishop, Black Knight, Bishop's Scepter, The Rook, King's Pawn, The King, and Apache Peak itself.  See descriptions for each of these individual climbs for details.  From the summit area on Shoshoni, descend on talus toward the towers until you reach a notch that marks the start of the ridge proper.  Stay east of the White Knight and climb the White Knight and Knight's Pawn (4th class).  Descend off the tower and proceed south to the Queen.

The capstone creates overhangs on several aspects.  The whole tower seems to lean out to the west over the expanse of air above Lone Eagle Cirque.  The whole project looks improbable from every angle.  From a position south of the Rook, traverse north along a narrow ledge, staying on the east side of the main ridge.  This ledge leads to a comfortable belay just below a notch between the Rook and a much smaller finger of rock that might as well be called the Rook's Pawn.  From the belay, traverse south to a thick, detached flake and traverse right to get on top of the flake, which forms a ledge.

The 0.6 mile traverse from South Arapahoe (13,397') in which you hardly gain or lose any elevation was loose, wet, and exposed at all the wrong times.  Pulling an overhung 5.4 boulder problem off snow in mountain boots with a 1500' drop to the Arapahoe glacier below while wearing a pack full of ice gear is interesting, but there's better things to do.  Same goes for jumping off a muddy ledge into a 4'x4' patch of snow with drops on both sides, and climbing a final sloppy snow gully with a long runout to the glacier.  Don't get me wrong, there's lots of good climbing to be had, good scenery, and a cool 100' catwalk that has fantastic exposure.  Just wait for the snow to melt before trying it.    To give the route a little more credit, on the return trip I found some better routes to bypass the snow gully and snow-platform jump and had a little more fun - a hint: don't follow the paint marks in the slot or the bit cairns leading east near the summit.

From the notch north of the Devil's Thumb, begin climbing north, north-east from the notch as per the Devil's Spiral Route. After 40 feet, when you effectively reach a ramp band that spirals along the east face of the thumb (the Spiral Route continues this way), head straight up to the summit for approximately 60-70 feet following crack systems the whole way.  20 feet from the summit block proper, you will encounter three choices to the summit. We took what I wagered as technically the easiest line, straight up a 5.5-5.6 hand crack which diagonals up and left. The foot work is great, and the crux protects with pieces ranging from 0.75--1.5 inches (I used a hex here).  Although the crux is relatively short, the line is direct, aesthetic, and generates very little rope drag. It should be done in 1 pitch from the notch. Moreover, it allows the leader to watch the second all the way to the summit block.  DESCENT:  Rappel from slings around the summit block. One 60 meter rope is required here.

We chose the most obvious corner system near the edge of the southeast and southwest face, and climbed four good pitches to the top. By Indian Peaks standards, this is a five-star route, with generally excellent rock (usual lichen and loose blocks warnings apply). It's quite possible someone had climbed parts of our first and fourth pitches (because they're obvious route funnels), but our second and third pitches are likely new.  1. 5.9, 120 feet. Start at the biggest, easiest-looking left-facing corner, just right of the junction of the southeast and southwest faces.

Start up shallow left-facing corner, straight above the belay. After traversing left below small overlap about 40 feet up, place as much gear as you can find, and either A) face-climb straight left 10 feet (crux) and then up to find good holds and pro, or B) continue straight up the corner or up and right, possibly finding better gear but probably not easier climbing. We did version A: exciting but excellent climbing. After rejoining the corner, continue up another 25 feet (second crux) to an awkward stance on a flake.  3. 5.9, 185 feet.

Follow this all-too-short crack up left-facing corner and through a small roof, then climb up and right to good ledges about 100 feet above the belay. Might be best to belay here for rope drag and communication. Climb the short overhanging corner above or step right 10 feet and follow a short, arching fist flake back left. Climb another short left-facing corner, then follow a short steep corner at the intersection of the solid orange rock and less solid gray rock. There's a sting-in-the-tail crux stepping back left at the top to reach a good belay ledge.  4. 5.8, 80 feet.

This mountain dominates the view from the trail in the Middle St. Vrain Creek valley.  Elk Tooth has a very steep south face, a 4-mile-long east ridge connecting it with St. Vrain Mountain, and a shorter but very rugged west ridge connecting it with Ogalalla Peak.  A slender and obvious couloir on its east face also looks inviting.',\n",
       " \"Follow the trail up the Middle St. Vrain valley to about 10,800', then leave the trail and climb a gully (snow in June, loose scree later in summer) up to a shoulder east of the summit of Elk Tooth at 12,100'.  This gully is not pleasant after the snow melts out, but the best footing is to the right side on grassy or rocky areas.  Follow the ridge west over a few false summits to the summit of Elk Tooth.  One false summit even contains a false summit register!  The actual summit of Elk Tooth is stunning, as it sits above a steep cliff on the south face.  The real joy in this route, however, is that you can continue on to Ogalalla Peak.  See the East Ridge of Ogalalla Peak for details.\",\n",

No [bolts], there is only a vague, but stellar, trad route about 1400' from the lake to the summit, although not all of it requires to be roped climbing.  The buttress is on the southeast side of the peak, but the approach is from the west, so it's a bit of a walk, over 6.5 miles.  The descent is easily facilitated by walking down the west ridge to the saddle between Haimovi Tower and Haimovi Mountain.

       " 'James Peak (13,294\\') lies in an interesting location in the Indian Peaks Wilderness.  From its summit, you can easily see Winter Park, Gray\\'s and Torrey\\'s, Evans and Bierstadt, and to the east, Boulder County.  There are several easy routes to the summit that are popular with hikers, but there are also several high quality technical routes on the east face.  The approach is not too long, and the east side basin does not see too much traffic (at least in the early season).    The technical routes are best done from May-July as they are snow and ice climbs up the fantastic couloirs on James Peak\\'s east face.  Super Star couloir is mostly steep snow, but some 5.4 scrambling is required to bypass a cornice at the top.  Another couloir, Shooting Star is a classic; a steep snow/ice climb that ends almost right on the summit.  Several other couloirs of varying difficulty ascend the eastern portion of the peak.  See Gerry Roach\\'s book \"Colorado\\'s Indian Peaks\" for more info.',\n",
       " 'This route may be considered a variation on the Starlight Couloir of James Peak.  Although this route is less worthy than Shooting Star and Super Star, it is certainly a more interesting climb than Starlight, so it deserves a name.  Begin by climbing about 1/4 to 1/3 of the way up Starlight Couloir.  Climb up and right into a slightly steeper couloir that drains into Starlight from the west.  About 200 feet up the route takes a turn to the left and proceeds parallel (and above) Starlight Couloir until it reaches the gentle SE ridge of James Peak at about 13,050 feet.',\n",
       " 'Shooting Star is an excellent mountaineering route that ascends a narrow couloir steeply to the summit on the east face of James Peak.  It is one of several impressive couloirs on James Peak, but Shooting Star takes the most direct line to the summit--a true classic.  Note: the \"rock\" description for directions and other info regarding Indian Peaks and James Peak.  The best season for this route is late May-July although quite varying conditions can be expected between this short span.  In May, the couloir is still hard packed snow, but watch out for rockfall in the initial wide couloir.  Although we didn\\'t see any rockfall, Roach notes that in May-early June, the upper wall is shedding rock.  By late June-July, the last 200ft. of the narrow and shady couloir is ice.  Also, since the route is on the east face, an early start is highly advisable.  We summited at 7:30am on a cloudy day in May and the snow started getting a little soft shortly afterward on the descent.  From the James Peak Lake in the east basin, hike around the lake (either way) to end up on its NW side.  Climb up the moderately steep snow field covering a talus slope to the upper basin below James Peak\\'s east face.  Shooting Star, Super Star, and Sky Pilot couloirs all star up the same wide snow field under the middle of the face.  The first couloir you\\'ll pass is Sky Pilot, which veers south (left) at a lower angle.  Keep climbing higher into the narrowing couloir (about 40deg slope) and you\\'ll see Super Star heading steeply off to the right.  Shooting Star is the other narrow couloir (obviously--the only other one) that angles left.    The angle and width of the couloir gradually steepens and narrows as one nears the summit.  The climbing is exciting as you\\'re trying to concentrate on moving up, but constantly looking down at the awesome couloir below.  The final short section is 60deg and deposits you a skip and a jump from the summit.    From a camp at the James Peak Lake, you can expect to summit in about 2-3 hours and be back to camp well before lunch.  To DESCEND, hike northeast from the summit down a gentle scree slope past the topout of Super Star (look down at the cornice from a rock point to the east) and then another 300m downhill to the east until you see a more gentle slope for glissading.  Although this slope is south-facing, it should be nice for glissading most of the season.  At the bottom of this slope, you\\'ll be able to navigate back to the NW shore of the lake.  PHOTOS COMING SOON!!',\n",
       " \"Sky Pilot is the easiest couloir on James Peak, but still has enough challenge to keep one on their toes.  See the James Peak 'rock' description for directions.  I would suggest the Upper or Lower Mammoth Gulch trailheads, we parked at the lower trailhead and had an enjoyable hike in - we estimated it to be about 6-7 miles round trip.  Keep your eyes open and up as you approach the base of the route.  At several times there should be good views of the face and the couloirs.  Sky Pilot is the lower angled couloir rising to the left.  After starting up the opening snow ramp Sky Pilot will continue left while Shooting Star and Super Star rise directly above.  The Sky Pilot couloir starts out rather wide and gradually narrows as you ascend.  We caught it a bit late and the snow was already melted out in a couple areas.  As you near the top, the couloir splits.  Going to the left is said to be a bit easier; on our trip there was more snow on the right, so our decision was made.  At the very top the snow finally gave way to loose rock on a steep slope.  The trail is right there & the summit just a short ways away.  We had a fun time on Sky Pilot.  The slope of the snow stays moderate, making it a nice climb to work on technique or be introduced to the medium. \",\n",
       " \"This couloir is not on the main east face of James Peak but on the north-facing slopes east of the main east face.  It is a quarter mile or so east of Shooting Star and Sky Pilot and only about half as long (and much easier than Shooting Star).  The couloir reaches the mellow SE ridge of James Peak at a small notch at 12,950'.  As with most snow climbs on James Peak, a helmet is recommended on this route because of the potential for rockfall.  This is a mellow snow climb and makes for a fun ski descent.  Conditions are usually best in late May to early June.  Unlike other couloirs on the peak, there is no cornice at the top of this one.  It is probably the easiest couloir on James to ski because it is short and has a fairly good runout after the first few hundred feet.  The upper section is about 35 degrees and less than 20' wide, however, so you need to be able to make fast turns.  Use one of the approaches in the description.  If skiing, probably the best approach is from St. Mary's Glacier, although this does not allow you to climb the couloir first.  This couloir is not visible when approaching from Mammoth Gulch until you enter the upper basin.  Then you will see it well left of Sky Pilot.  It is quite broad lower down but narrows considerably for the last few hundred feet.  Starlight can be somewhat difficult to find from the top.  We identified it as the only narrow strip of snow that actually reaches the ridge around 13,000'.  The worst hazard when skiing this chute is sliding into a rock wall, so wear a helmet.  Because of it's northern exposure this chute softens up later that the other couloirs on James.  However by late June, the snow is generally gone from the top of this couloir and becomes an evil scree chute.  Avoid this couloir if the top is melted out.\",\n",
       " \"From the top of St. Mary's Glacier, head NW across an alpine meadow and then drop down into the cirque on the east side of James Peak. Head SW and go around the south side of James Peak lake. Climb the scree slope up into the bowl half way up the eastern face. The climb begins up the obvious, deeply inset couloir on your right.  Once in the couloir, the route is obvious. Follow the snow slope up. The snow conditions were excellent and we chose to climb the entire route unroped.  Depending upon the time of the year, the entire couloir may be snow filled or there may be sections of rock to climb. The rock sections are rated 5.4 in Roach's guide, though what rock we climbed didn't appear that hard. The crux of the climb is at the top where a cornice may be present. When we climbed in July '02, the last pitch was all rock, with the easiest line on the right side of the couloir.  There was one move around a block which gave pause.  Other than that, and stepping over the moats from the rock back onto the snow, everything was straight forward.  The top of the couloir empties out onto the hiking trail running up the NE ridge. Head left about 400 yards to the top.\",\n",

       " \"Similar for the majority of the route to the steepness of Snow Lion, it adds further dimensions by way higher fall consequences and a final 10-20' crux of near vertical to overhanging snow.  The summit cornice melts out to the possible by late June.  Start early as the crux receives sun the soonest of all routes on Jasper's east face.\",\n",
       " \"Snow Lion starts gently and steepens at two distinct sections.  The first steep section is at a constriction in route.  If you look closely the snow pulls away from the rocks underneath and some crevasse type features come to the surface.  Punching through would not be advised!  The second steep section is right at the ridge crest.  As you near the ridge crest the route steepens considerably and the snow got rotten.  The snow on our June 24th ascent was in great shape with the exception of the last 200'.  The face gets an early sun hit and the top had taken a considerable amount of sun be the time we topped out.   \",\n",

From the 4th of July trailhead and just below Skywalker Couloir on South Arapaho, look west to the east-facing buttress coming off the NE ridge and you will see two thin snow routes.  I climbed the right fork/couloir and took the left branch of this line at the top putting me just below the summit.  I soloed the route and in an October ascent and encountered good snow, bad snow, and moderate mixed climbing through rock bands to avoid the bad snow.  In spring, this may be an all-snow route.  In fall, expect to climb rock as well.  The crux for me was the rock bands about mid-route and the thin snow high in the left branch near the top.    I named this route \"Turf War\" due to the fact that when I climbed it, I encountered mixed climbing on snow, ice, s\\'nice, rock, etc.  It was a fight all the way to the top.

       " \"This moderate alpine rock route is classic both for the quality of the climbing and the sheer ambience of the wall it tackles.  The long approach to Lone Eagle Peak ensures solitude and the cirque itself is unmatched for beauty in the entirety of the Indian Peaks.  Despite the moniker, most of the climbing takes place on the east side of the peak.  Scramble southeast up a steep grassy slope for 200 yards from Crater Lake to the base of the east face.  The route starts from the talus field just over the crest -- look for a large, tree-filled bench.    P1: Climb wet black rock (5.4) past a pin, aiming between the two large trees on the bench.  P2-4: Follow a 5.0 ramp up and south (climber's left), climbing over, around and through numerous trees en route.  You can break this bit up or simul-climb.  It's mostly 3rd and 4th class.  It helped me to scope this bit out from the valley below and to the east of the peak, since only the final pitches are visible from Crater Lake.  P5: The ramp ends at a grassy gully which splits the east face.  Climb broken rock (5.3) straight up this cleft to the base of a deep, water-streaked chimney.  P6: Climb the chimney (5.5), making use of the positive face holds on the right wall to get past a few tricky spots.  P7-8: Grassy slopes interspersed with occasional rock steps (5.4) lead to the top of the cleft, which deposits you on a huge ledge system below the summit cliffs.  P9: 3rd or 4th class south up blocky ramps to reach the summit cliff band.  P10:  The crux!  This 150-foot pitch follows a pair of twin cracks on the northwest-facing summit headwall, about 100 feet west of the prominent arete where the east and north faces meet.  Don't be suckered into trying the diagonalling twin cracks closer to the arete -- it's off route.  You'll know you're on route if you pass 4 old pins.

We set out, no guide (not even an MP printout!), no previous knowledge of area, no beta for route or tricky sounding descent.  Low on sleep and not arriving to the base of Lone Eagle until 11:30am.  We decided against a longer route and searched for something less committing.  We did 3 routes, 1 easy trad, 2 TRs. From L>R:  Route #1, *, \"Sleep In Until 3\" trad protected, 5.6. Start deep into chimney between Sleep-In Block and opposite rock, stemming the chimney up approximately 15 feet.  Lunge right (crux) then follow the easy steps and plentiful pro to the top.

Gain left-slanting crack and traverse out to edge of lower arete.  Fire up onto upper part of route on thin side-pulling crimpers until a good crimpy ledge.

Step up and reach higher than possible for a super positive hold.  This draws a funny looking move, but both of us did it both times as it is the most natural feeling thing.

       " 'This is the easiest route to the classic summit of Lone Eagle and in reverse is also the descent from any route summiting Lone Eagle (including Solo Flight itself). While \"only\" 4th class, it is very exposed and features devious route finding on terrain that quickly exceeds 4th class if a wrong turn is taken, which can easily happen despite the numerous cairns en-route, especially when climbing the route for the first time in reverse after an ascent of the N. Face route. I won\\'t say anything else about that other than if going in reverse, look in every direction for the next cairn, and don\\'t misinterpret a random pile of rocks!! I excerpt here almost verbatim (differences in []\\'s) from Gerry Roach\\'s description of Solo Flight, from the 1989 Indian Peaks Wilderness Area Guide. The differences are mostly because it seems to me that some of the directions were off. Also because if you try to follow directions too carefully on this climb, you have to enjoy being totally confused, so I\\'m trying to confuse you even more (e.g. just follow your nose).  From the northeast side of Crater Lake, climb southeast to a point just below the north face of Lone Eagle. Continue climbing southeast and stay below the cliffs of Lone Eagle\\'s northeast face. The easiest going is actually right under the cliffs, and you may find some wonderful flower displays at the base of the rocks. It is also reasonable to hike across talus some distance below the cliffs.  Stay below the cliffs and continue south to a point where you can look down on Triangle Lake. It is 0.5 miles from the base of the north face to this point. It is not necessary to go to Triangle Lake, only to see it. The cliffs of Lone Eagle finally start to relent and the route ascends southwest up a ramp bordered on its north side by a dwindling cliff band. Look sharp for a good place to leave the ramp and climb northwest (right) up through this cliff band. There are at least three places to ascend this cliff band with 50 feet of Class 3 climbing. Some cairns mark the upper two places.  Once you are above the dwindling cliff band, traverse north on a broad ramp. You are finally headed toward the summit instead of away from it! After 200 yards of traversing, do an ascending traverse northwest up broken ledges to a pair of small notches in the convoluted ridge. This ascending traverse follows the path of least resistance and involves an occasional Class 3 move. The two notches are [along a spur from the north-south ridge].  The view north from the [south-east] notch can be disheartening at first, but at least you can finally see the summit. It is 250 yards north and below you. The summit is not the highest point on the ridge, but it is the farthest north. Climb [south] through the [south-east] notch and descend 20 feet on the [south-west] side of the ridge (Class 3). Turn [north-west] (right) and climb 30 feet into another notch with a curious chockstone in it (Class 3).   From here on the route is exposed and more serious. There is a steep gully descending north from the notch with the chockstone in it. Get on the west side of this gully, traverse north and descend slightly to a series of easy ledges 100 feet north of the notch (Class 3). There are at least two ways to accomplish this maneuver. These ledges are on the east side of the ridge running north toward the summit.  Traverse north 100 yards on the ledges (Class 3). When the ledges bump into cliffs, descend 70 feet east down a south-angling Class 4 pitch to a lower series of ledges. This pitch is the crux of the route and can be downclimbed or rappelled. If desired, a rope can be left in place on this pitch to aid the return trip.  Traverse north 200 feet on the lower series of ledges (Class 3) and engage the single closed contour of the summit. Ascend 60 feet northwest across the east side of the summit ridge to the summit (Class 4). The job isn\\'t complete until you tiptoe north 30 feet on the narrow ridge to the most spectacular point.  This is a complicated route, but take heart. It follows the path of least resistance, consists mostly of easy Class 3 scrambling, is festooned with cairns and, most important of all, leads to an incredible summit.',\n",

We stuck as close as possible to the central rib and found some lovely face and crack climbing, including a cool arete section on the third pitch. There\\'s definitely some loose rock, but it\\'s not bad at all by Indian Peaks standards, and it would clean up with traffic.  The 1974 AAJ describes a route just to the right of our line, up the \"southernmost of three dihedrals.\" Undoubtedly there have been other ascents. Mountaineers who enjoy moderate alpine-y routes like the Spiral Route on Notchtop or the Inwood Arete on Quandary would love this climb. It\\'s climbable anytime from the road opening until early fall, but probably at its best in June, when there\\'s still lots of snow around to give it an alpine ambiance and to cover some of the junk left and right of the rib. However, a large cornice may loom above the face in early season. We felt this would fall to the left of our line if it broke, but make your own judgment.

       " \"Follow the well-marked and well-travelled trail out of the parking lot for approximately 3 miles to Arapahoe Pass.  Along the way you'll pass some old mining equipment, and the trail for the Arapahoe Glacier Trail.  Continue east until you begin to pass Lake Dorothy on your left.  There are great views of North and South Arapaho Peaks to the northwest, and Caribou Lake is visible to the north.  Follow a very faint trail across the grass to the base of North Ridge, where the trail becomes slightly more pronounced.  Pick your way south along the ridge.  We dropped slightly below the ridgeline to the east several times to avoid what looked to be harder-than-fourth-class moves.  The crux is navigating a steep notch between Point 12,536 and Point 12,700 (two intermediate peaks on the ridge).  The view of the notch while approaching was initially a little intimidating, but our concerns proved to be unfounded the closer we got.  We approached the notch from the east side of the ridge, heading up grassy slopes.  Once in the notch, the 20-30 foot crux wall presents itself, and is quickly overcome.  Above the wall, we picked our way (along a faint trail) just below and west of the ridge proper for a few hundred feet.  The remainder of the ridge to Neva is a pleasant grassy hike.  Descent:  From the summit, it's probably easiest to simply reverse course and follow the ridge north back to the trail.    It might be possible to continue on to Jasper Peak, and back to the trailhead via its Northeast Ridge.  (We were concerned about the weather, and came down from the saddle between Neva and Jasper, to the two lakes visible from Neva's summit, and picked our way back north and east to the trail.  This descent allows you to lose elevation quickly and get off the ridge, but is certainly more time consuming than simply following the North Ridge back.)\",\n",

There is an easy Class 2 hiking route to the summit on the southern side and several easy/moderate technical rock climbs on the northern side. The cliff on the northern side is solid granite and the position of the climbing is \"classic\" Colorado alpine. The actual climbing is about 200m with the option of a harder, independent summit tower (that can be avoided by 4th class scrambling). The routes on this cliff are really great \"beginner\" alpine rock climbs, not overly committing with a walk off descent. There are also some very nice spring snow climbing and skiing possibilities. Early starts required for all routes to avoid the standard afternoon thundershowers and lightning. Wildflowers are abundant in July and August.

Third class up and around this huge and obvious ledge about 400 feet to a steep drop off into a gully.  Look for the weakness that will allow you to traverse into the gully (5.3).  Cross the gully to the other side, and begin climbing up again.  Do not go up the gully or you will end up in a loose choss-pile of a trench.

We jumped on this route because the wind was gusting over the N Ridge at probably 25-30 mph with gusts to 40 mph and we didn't bring adequate clothing to enjoy those conditions.    See the approach described for the North Ridge.  Count on about 2 to 2 1/2 h.  From the saddle north of Mt. Toll, we traverse SSE to get out of the wind and lo and behold, it was sheltered.  There was this narrow rib of rock between 2 chimney systems.  However, it turned out looser and wetter than it looked.  But we weren't the first fools to do it.  P1. We scrambled up perhaps 150 feet on 3rd-4th class terrain to a small nook/ledge.  I'd recommend considering a rope.  A wire and #0.75 Camalot for the belay.  There was an ancient bolt somewhere near here.  P2. Surmount a slightly bulging bit, 4th class, manky rock to a L-facing dihedral.  Found, tested, and pulled out with finger pressure an ancient piton in a crack.  200 feet.  P3.  Continued up on funky, loose terrain to a ledge.  Used #0.75 Camalot and #1 Camalot at belay at the base of a crack system.  200 feet.  P4.  Crux pitch.  Up the crack, traverse R, step up, go over a bulge, do some face moves that make you wish the rock were dry.  80 feet.  P5.  Continue up more moderate rock as it eases to 3rd class terrain. 200 feet puts you just below the summit.  \",\n",
       " 'From Boulder, Mount Toll is an obvious sharply-profiled peak back [in the] Indian Peaks.  On the north and south sides a ridge of good rock rises up at the edge of a steep, but broken East and West Faces.    The \"North Ridge\" is both a feature and a route.  As a route it is a somewhat ambiguous and moderate line, or perhaps more accurately, a set of lines.  There run up the profile of the... you guessed it, NORTH side ridge of Mount Toll.  If this same face were in Eldo there would be a dozen named routes on it, but as it is, it\\'s pretty much a broad range of climbing through which most people pick the line of least resistance.    The climbing is a little discontinuous, a little wandering, and a shave runout in spots, so the quality is not 3-star quality, but the position and view make this a stellar line.  The summit is no less note-worthy.  To climb the route approach over a the boulder fields, aiming for the basin just below and to the north of the sharp North Ridge of Rock.  Cross some snow fields and scramble up some steep loose talus to reach a saddle just on the north shoulder of the peak, below the ridge.  Head to the West side of the North Ridge and look back south and east to see a right-leaning, right-facing set of dihedrals.  At first glance, these look like they might be 5.9, but where the cracks get overhanging and hard, one can step to the right and do some face climbing to avoid difficulty.  This is an excercise in route-finding and using slings to avoid drag.  Climb a pitch then belay when you run out of rope, gear, or have too much drag.  Belays are not everywhere, so do some planning in advance to avoid getting stranded.  I belayed off of a few good nuts in a short right facing corner up in the crack system- where I found the remains of an old fixed hex in a horizontal below me.  There was no cord left to clip.  For the next pitch I continued up and slightly back left to a crack system which included a nice handcrack and then a thinner crack with an old, (perhaps 1950s) soft-iron pin.  Again, I landed up on a nice sloping ledge and walked to the back and built a belay.  You might still find my brown Tricam in said belay, which apparently I got set very well.  The third pitch was up and left again to a boiler-plate face with beautiful movement and stone- if it was a 200\\' face I\\'d be raving about it, but the truely nice section was short, so I\\'ll just call it \"good.\"  Again, I walked some distance back from the edge, got a good stance, slung a boulder and belayed my partner up.  That was the basic route.  Additional climbing potential lies above this point on the summit tower- about 80M more, if I were to hazard a guess.  It looked like one could take a probable 5.9+ up and off-width to easier ground on the right, with garbage rock at the base to start and improving, or go left and sort out any one of the probable crack systems from 5.8 to 5.11.  Again, the rock looked a little less solid here at the base.  Weather was a concern and so we did the standard finish.  To summit, walk South on a series of ledges and 3rd class sections on the West side [of] the summit block until it becomes obvious that you should cut back north to the peak along a ridgeline.  This was very moderate and [comfortable] scrambling, but the consequences of a fall could have been severe in some spots.  Consider roping up if the thought of a 500\\' fall from 5.0 moves makes you nervous.  To descend, walk off to the south and then to the Southeast back toward Blue Lake.  Some scrambing is required on the walkdown.  Per Buzz: the skyline ridge seen from below is NOT the route. It should be, as that is the true north ridge connecting to the Continental Divide, but it\\'s harder and somehow got a \\'bomb\\' rating, so no one does it. Instead, the North Ridge route is slightly off to the west side and only once touches any kind of ridge.   It\\'s basically 4th class up a series of ramps and ledges - lots of variations possible. You know you\\'re on route when you get to a deep, steep, obvious dihedral with a ring piton on the left side (with a turquoise runner through it for the past 5 years). This is the crux and is only 6m long. With a little back-stem at the top, it\\'s totally solid somewhere in the 5.0-5.4 range. It is probably as hard as the top of the Third Flatiron. This puts you briefly and for the first time on a bench on the real north ridge (the notch which is visible on the skyline when seen on the approach), which is steep, but it\\'s easy to walk around to the right (west), and after more wandering there\\'s another 4th class headwall, and you pop out just below the top.',\n",

There are two national Forest campgrounds a few miles before the trailhead.  Park at the pull out and hike up the dirt road past a large bridge and up the hill for some 100 yards. A small sign on the left besides gate and a small trail will let you know that the first mile of the trail is on private property. Follow this smaller trail, [go] left and past another bridge (smaller) over a waterfall. All water on this basin is contaminated with heavy metals and arsenic so bring your own. There is a sign-in station somewhere along this section of the trail.  Continue on this small trail for about a mile until you reach a third creek with yet a smaller bridge. From here, follow the trail some 20-30 yards and watch hard for a trail going left. There was a small cairn when I was there. The trails split after a small rise. Take the LEFT trail. The right one takes you up the Northwest ridge route which will be your descent...  Follow this trail for 1.5 miles as it countours a couple of ridges. This trail becomes faint after a while and care must be taken not to lose it. Eventually the trail will turn right past a rock buttress (right side) and will reach a 4th creek. Follow this creek up the mountain. There is a primitive trail on the right (West) side of the creek. Resist all urges to bushwhack. It is nasty....  Follow the creek up for some 1000 feet until you can see the talus field on your left above tree line. Cross the creek and head for the rocks. Climb the loose talus field for some 1200 feet. This is horrible, and it is the price to pay for the fun that is to come.  Once above the talus you are on the shoulder leading to the ridge. All 2 miles of it appear in front of you. Have at it. All difficulties can be bypassed on the left (East) although some significant altitude must be lost and regained if you want to keep it at Class 3. We stayed on the ridge some 85% of the time and did a lot of Class 3, a large amount of Class 4 and some 5.easy stuff particularly on the downclimbs. We downclimbed a few of the towers on the right so look for creative solutions.  As the ridge climbs up to the peak there is a 1,300ft elevation gain. Just what you needed after 1.5 miles of Class 4 at 13,000ft. Stay on the ridge to avoid the heinous talus field on the left. Climb the false summit and make one last push for the real summit.  Head down the Northwest trail which is Class 2 and well marked once you leave the talus field.  Time estimates (these are our times, we are no record beaters but move relatively fast)Trailhead to Ridge: 2 hrs, Ridge to Summit 4hrs, car to car 8 hours. We took helmets but no ropes, harnesses, or pro. Light is might on this baby.  Escapes - For most of the time while on the ridge you can escape West into the basin and thus towards your car. This can be done via Horrible talus chutes that will probably forever alter your ankles and knees, but I guess it is doable. Once you reach the section where the ridge rises towards the summit the fastest way down is through the summit and down the Northwest route.  Escaping East looked really nice, vegetated, not too steep slopes. However you will wind up in a completly different basin some 10-15 miles from your car.... Better not have to escape from this one....\",\n",
       " \"Begin at the Lake Creek Trailhead. Cross a bridge and continue for 0.3 miles on the South Fork Lake Road until past private property, and find trail signage. Follow trail/skin tracks 200 meters until you find a bridge that crosses a gorge of the South Fork of Lake Creek. Follow trail/skin tracks east until you cross La Plata Gulch Creek (go up and higher if crossing is difficult). Follow creek until out of the trees, and pick your ascent up the North Ridge. Follow the North Ridge up to the top of La Plata Peak.  At the summit, head northwest to a small windbreak. The steepest run is just left of this. I preferred the next couloir to the left. Ski line to the basin, then ski left of the lake, and stay as high as you can to reach the bench of the Northwest Ridge without too much effort.

Hit the stream draining LaPlata basin and turn south (right). Follow trail on the west side of the stream up into LaPlata basin. This trail is unmaintained and numerous blowdowns will hinder your progress. Occasionally the trail will wander away from the stream, but minimal route finding skills will keep you on track. When you break out of the trees into an area of low growing shrubs, the north face of LaPlata will be right in front of you. At some point, cross to the east bank of the stream and continue south to the scree slopes leading up the face. The route we took was the western most couloir running up the face.   Climb the western most couloir. This is a moderate snow climb of appx. 30 to 40 degrees. We encountered some rockfall when the sun hit the upper slopes, but we could avoid it by staying on the east (left) side of the couloir. About half way up, the couloir turns left and slightly steepens. Near the top, we encountered ice, but at a moderate angle. At any time near the top, you can traverse right onto the rocks for a relatively easy scramble, if you want to avoid the ice.',\n",
       " \"Little Bear lies a mile southwest of Blanca and has a reputation as one of Colorado's most difficult fourteeners.  People may therefore be surprised to learn that Little Bear was first climbed in 1888, before Blanca!  The fact of the matter is that there is an easy (meaning 3rd class) route on Little Bear, however the start of this route is on private land and therefore closed (the most obvious start, anyway).  Little Bear is therefore almost always climbed from the popular Lake Como access road, and this standard route is one of the most difficult and dangerous of any fourteener. \",\n",
       " 'Wear a helmet!  This climb is a less-traveled alternative to the Hourglass Couloir route on Little Bear that ascends the impressive northwest face of Little Bear. It connects with the Little Bear-Blanca ridge near the summit of Little Bear. Most of the work is picking your way through the 3rd class talus and scree at a fairly high angle. Two points on the route _may_ require the use of pro: gaining the \"shelf\" above the \"Black Hand\" on the rock, gaining the ridge close to the summit. People have reported being able to pass the \"black hand\" to climbers right while keeping it 4th class.  Once you\\'ve passed the \"Black Hand\", follow the steep 3rd class gullies up to a more level area. Head up and right to a weakness in the ridge. You may want to simul-climb to the top of the ridge, continuing to the summit.   Arguably safer when snow-covered, since it likes to shed rock, particularly in rain storms. ',\n",
       " \"A quarter mile past Lake Como a cairn marks a path south up a steep rocky couloir to the ridge crest.  This couloir is rather unpleasant and loose and ends at a saddle at 12,580'.  From here, either head up the ridge (east) or cross the saddle and immediately turn east, contouring across the south face, following a cairned traverse.  The first option puts you on top of pt. 12,980'.  Drop down to the next saddle and then pick up a cairned route which traverses across and up the south and then southwest face to the base of the Hourglass Couloir, which lies on the SW face of Little Bear.  The second option leads to the same place without going over the top of pt. 12,980'.  You are now ready to enter the Hourglass.  Beware!  It would be difficult to design a more dangerous route from the perspective of rockfall.  Any rock which is knocked off the upper 500' of the route is channeled straight through the Hourglass, which is only about 10' wide at the narrowest point.  Thus, climbing this couloir with another party above you is akin to playing Russian Roulette.  I would heed Lou Dawson's advice and plan to climb this monster on a week day.  You can start early and try to beat everyone else, but you may still have to deal with them on the way down (which is a good reason to do the traverse).  The bottom of the Hourglass is a smooth slab and comprises the crux of the route.  Avoid grabbing the fixed ropes or you will have to record your ascent as 4th class, A0 (just kidding, you can do whatever you like).  This section is not difficult when dry.  Unfortunately snow, ice, and water tend to linger here.  At the neck of the Hourglass, look for numerous scars in the rock where high speed boulders have impacted.  There is nobody above, right?  Soon after passing through the neck of the Hourglass you reach a big ledge with the anchoring for the fixed ropes (was the rappel anchor).  From here on the climbing is only 3rd class, however extreme caution is required to avoid knocking rocks on people below you.  At this point, you can climb up and right, or left and then more or less straight up.  We chose the latter option which heads directly to the summit after about 400 vertical feet.  Despite all the warnings, I found this to be an enjoyable route -- since there was nobody above us.  It may be the best route on the mountain if you are lucky enough to find it unoccupied.Due to its geometry, the upper part of this route is extremely dangerous for multiple and large parties.  Unless you are very trusting of other people, don't climb through the neck of the Hourglass when anyone is climbing the upper 3rd class section.  Unfortunately, it can be hard to tell if there is a group above you when you are at the base of the Hourglass.  I would give people an hour to get from the base of the Hourglass to the summit.  Since the Hourglass faces mostly west, snow and water tend to linger in it.  It is quite common to encounter verglas here, and September snowstorms can increase the difficulty substantially.  If there is enough snow or ice, the fixed ropes will be buried!\",\n",
       " 'Gain the West Ridge proper as described for the West Ridge (Hourglass) route. After passing the last large notch in the ridgline, climb to the ridge proper, instead of traversing south to the Hourglass gully. Once on the west ridge proper, stay on the top of the ridge for nearly the entire climb, negotiating the towers and headwalls as they come.    There are two \"crux\" sections on this route, a roughly 5.4 chimney with a large chockstone at the top, followed shortly by a 5.2 slab with some old webbing near the top.   The 5.4 Chimney   The 5.2 Slab   Near the summit we turned south towards some cairns that mark the upper portion of the hourglass route, however, I think you can stay on the ridge all of the way to the summit. The West Ridge Direct route is a very rarely climbed variation on the West Ridge route. Basically it simply follows Little Bear\\'s prominent west ridgeline all the way to the summit. I climbed after doing the standard (Hourglass) route, and one of the guys with me had previously done the Northwest Face. The consensus was that this route is much more difficult and exposed than either of those. The ridgeline varies in width from about 4\\' at the widest sections, down to less than 1\\' at the narrowest.   The exposure is extreme, the climbing is scary, and the rock is not so great, but overall it is an incredibly fun route.

Unfortunately, you have to go down at some point, and the descent routes aren't overly enjoyable.

Approach this classic snow/ice climb via the Maroon Bells TH and Crater Lake.  Hike about a half mile past the lake to the talus runout below the couloir, then head straight up toward it.  A cairn marks the cutoff point.  Follow the right side of the runout and a faint trail past the obvious cliff/notch, and traverse in to the left to gain the snow.  Climb over 2,000' of steepening snow/ice to the notch between the Maroon Bells and enjoy.  The angle reaches about 55 degrees in the upper 1/3.    From the notch, follow the Maroon Ridge to South Maroon Peak (3rd-4th class) or North Maroon Peak (5.4ish) and descend one of the standard routes, or descend the couloir (carefully, with soft snow).

If you climb the Bell Cord Couloir first (in my opinion the most enjoyable option, and the fastest), this is how you'll do it.  By the way, the rock (at least on the ridge) isn't as bad as they say.  From the summit of South Maroon, head back toward the Bell Cord Couloir notch.  Either keep to the ridge or to the west side, following cairns as much as possible.  From the notch, head straight up the 4th class wall in front of you.  Follow steps and cairns and occasional dead ends up the ridge to the first improbable-looking 5th class section.  It goes at about 40' of 5.2 or so.  Some more routefinding will bring you to a flat area on the ridge with a blunt prow blocking your way.  A 30' section of steep 5.4-5.5 rock (we found it just left of center) will get you past it.  A rap sling was on top.  Follow the ridge past a few more difficulties to the last climb up to the summit of North Maroon Peak and the last 4th class climbing.  Descend off the northeast ridge, following cairns and a faint trail down (4th class).  Dawson's guide is a great reference for the descents of both peaks.

       " 'I am doing a disservice to this site by adding the Moron\\'s Bells Traverse, otherwise called the Megamoronal Traverse. Let\\'s be honest. It is quite possibly the most idiotic chossfest on here.   Why am I adding it? Quite simply, because some of you are idiots. What\\'s better than the Red, Rugged, and Rotten Cocktail for a full 20 miles and 12,000 feet of gain, constantly dodging loose rock and yarding off widow makers above the abyss? Not much.   Unfortunately, and I don\\'t mean to be rude, but you probably aren\\'t capable of doing this route. To be somewhat candid. It\\'s too long, too loose, too pointless, too complicated, and so forth, but here it is, for the moronically inclined:  The goal of the traverse is to run the ridge, tagging the points >13K feet surrounding Minnehaha Gulch and West Maroon Creek, starting at Buckskin Pass and ending at Pyramid. Yes, the ridge goes with some high bypassing, and for those who THINK they\\'re in shape enough to attempt this, it goes without rope. In a day would be most impressive.  The exact start and end can be modified, so long as you run the entire ridge between those two points. Also some may choose to start in Crested Butte, climb the eastern half first and then the western half, with a gear stash along the route. It doesn\\'t matter; whatever you choose is likely the wrong decision, since you shouldn\\'t be there in the first place.  The passes and peaks traveled include Buckskin Pass, UN 13039, Sleeping Sexton, North Maroon, South Maroon, Belleview Mountain, West Maroon Pass, UN 13130 (the true summit is actually SE of the ridge), UN 13180B, UN 13722 (\"Lightning Pyramid\"), Thunder Pyramid, and, finally, Pyramid Peak.  The logical starting place is Maroon Lake, though one attempt started outside of Crested Butte.  The western half is referred to as the Megamaroonal Traverse. The eastern half is the Megamidal. A smart person, which those attempting this route most certainly are not, would scout each of those routes first to even have a chance of doing the full Moron\\'s in a day.  The crux of the Megamaroonal section is Sleeping Sexton to the Gunsight prior to North Maroon. The key is to find a good ledge - generally on the W side - bypassing cliffs on the ridge. One should be able to stay fairly close to the ridge. The downclimbing is tricky, perhaps 5.easy for the most savy route-finders. The North Maroon to Maroon downclimb is much easier and cleaner in comparison. Watch out for the more dangerous choss between Maroon and Belleview.  The 5.4 crux of the Megamidal is Thunder Pyramid to Pyramid, a rather exposed chimney system on the east side of the ridge. Other than that, expect some rather intense route-finding and numerous sections of exposed 3rd, 4th, and low 5th scrambling. Describing the route is near impossible, and the route should be reserved for confident and experienced terrain navigators. Luckily, there are numerous bail spots, and it would behoove you to know where they are, since you\\'re likely to use one.

Angle left, lieback a right-facing corner, up a crack until it peters out, traverse left to a cool dike 5.7 (close up picture in this area) and angle left to a semi-hanging belay, 200 feet. You can use a #9 hex, 0.75 Camalot, red Alien, and wire for the belay.    P3. Go up over an overlap and then the angle lessens to a good ledge, 200 feet.    P4. Continue up easy ground with an optional 5.8 corner to the top, 110 feet.   Hitchhike or walkoff left and down the hiking trail past the 1st Apron or right past the 3rd Apron and down an obvious gully.\",\n",
       " '1.5 stars.  Not as good as the Right and Center lines on this apron. P2-4 are decent.   Another line up this slab.  We discovered on this trip to do another line up this \"climb anywhere you want\" slab/apron that it may not be as \"climb anywhere\" as described.  Sorry.  Probably too much detail on this route:  Initially, an effort up the middle between Right and Center routes, there is an inviting thin crack.  It has a pin about 35-40 ft up.  Then it gets thinner and more runout.  So, my partner bailed and rapped.  Too close to the ground and far enough from the car....  Second try, further left.  Not sure if this is entirely independent from the Second Apron Left side 5.8+ R described by Darin Lang [on] this site.  However, verbal descriptions don\\'t quite match.  On the left side of this buttress there is a 3rd-4th class ramp.    P1. About where this start to go up, went up & found a shallow, left-facing dihedral that was inviting but pro was marginal.  About 50 feet up here, you dance out right on rounded face holds aiming for a overlap with what looked like pro opportunities but given the marginal cams below you\\'re looking at a groundfall from 60 feet up if you don\\'t make it.  So backed down, moved left into a somewhat grungier section that is probably wet during less-arid years.  Looking for moderate ways up & right onto the main apron to the right, followed an arc to its left end but backed down and traversed left to a 1-1 1/2\" crack & a stance.  200 feet of dancing but 100 feet up, 5.5.  One of my partners 3rd classed up the ramp to here.    P2. Move up & left, aiming for a short, wide, zig-zag crack to gain this upper layer of good granite on the apron, then move up & generally slightly R as you dance back and forth on solid granite.  For a small landmark, there is a right-pointing flake next to a thin crack, both of which take wires, that you pass to the right.  For a larger landmark for the rest of the climb, you generally aim for just right of the what-appears-to-be two short, bulging headwalls (goalposts) at the top.  Aim for a small ledge with a flake on the L & a good hex slot on the right.  200 feet, 5.7.    P3. Move about 10 feet left & into a shallow, left-facing dihedral with some vegetation.  Move up to a raised flake on the right, slot a wire, move back down slightly and then right.  Gain a nice foot ramp with finer grained granite. Arc right & then left, climbing over a left-facing dihedral, aiming for an A-shaped overlap.  Place a wire.  This overlap protects a fair bit of moss/lichen still present.  Delicately smear left & move up into the apex (crux) to gain a good finger/hand slot.  Balance up.  A foot traverse left & up gets you to a good ledge.  200 feet, 5.8.    P4. Continue up the dihedral & right, go up a short slab on slightly crumbly holds, move R into a slot angling right & up.  Go up & then left along a short ar\\xc3\\xaate to a huge ledge & belay.  2 hexes and a wire.  180 feet, 5.7.  P5.  Lots of exits here are possible.   P5A. A nice, short, steep, finger to offwidth crack gains 3rd-4th class terrain.    P5B. A short bit of 5th class moves to the left and then back right into a slot pops you up on top.  105 feet, 5.6.   To descend, move down and right into the loose gully right of the rightmost apron.  Contour along the rightmost apron, and then up to your gear (if you left any at the base).  It may be possible to exit left from P1 or P2 onto 3rd-4th class terrain.  Sun until 230p in August.  Also, cell phones work well up here if you are on call, expecting a call or baby, etc.',\n",

The route generally stays on the left side of the photo below, finishing up the \"headwall\" which looks like a horn in the upper left of the photo below.  The last pitch and a half is above 14K, and you top out right at point 14,256 on Evans\\' West Ridge.  A stroll up the West Ridge proper (if you stay right on the ridge, fun second and third class on solid, sculpted rock) to the summit and a descent of the NE slopes makes for a fun tour of the Evans massif and a relatively short day.  Begin at the left angling crack system on the left side of the snow tongue (no snow there now!) in the photo below, and angle up left to a small overhang.  Traverse left under the overhang and over a slab to a right-facing, right-leaning system.  Follow this somewhat broken system of cracks, flakes, and slabs for 500-600 feet past mostly solid rock to a large grassy ledge just below the headwall (mostly 5.6 with some 5.7s).  Many options exist here, depending on your climbing ability and comfort level.  We went straight up to an obvious \"pod\" in the a crack above the ledge (maybe one move of 5.9), did a delicate hand traverse left (5.8), moved back right on another small ledge to a short finger crack in a dihedral.  Ascend this finger crack to a stance behind a leaning block, then climb a perfect, if short, hand and fist crack behind the block to another hand traverse left which deposits you on yet another small grassy ledge (5.8+ in several spots on this section).  Another 80-90 feet of 5.6 gets you to the summit from here.

We traversed in from the left towards the obvious, big, left-facing dihedral.  This 1st pitch (?300 feet) involved a bit of simul-climbing on low-angled slab with spots of 5.7 R to a belay near an overlap.  There is a pin near here.    P2. We went up and left into a crack to a stance.  Here decipher a perplexing, runout slab 5.9 to a ledge, traverse right into a dihedral which can be alpine (a bit loose and licheny), 160 feet. #2 and #3 Friends are useful at this semi-hanging belay.

A #5 Camalot(s) is useful here unless you have great arm bar & heel toe technique.  Suddenly, it eases off as you wonder what the heck you ate to make that 5.7 feel so... um... er... challenging.    P5-7 or 8. Climb about 600 feet more of easy rock to the top.  It is about 1400 feet of roped climbing in all.  There is a fair bit of fixed gear on the route, probably from someone\\'s epic.

Select the ledge easiest for you to access from the snowfield (it really doesn't matter which one, they all intersect the route).  Once on the ledge, climb up and to the left on slippery slabs with lots of moss and lichen in places until you come to a long slightly sloping ledge about 100 feet up.  Belay from here.

After the 4th pitch, we bailed off via a ledge that lead off to the left and back onto the snow.  I suppose it's possible to keep going straight up to the top of the Apron, but the pitches were decreasingly safe - the fourth pitch took only one [piece] of solid pro.  I'm sorry I cannot provide any more detail as to the route itself, this is because there really are no clearly defined features to the route, nor is there any fixed pro for [landmarks].

The reason is simple, situated at a very high altitude, between 12,000 and 13,000', the easiest way to reach the routes is to rappel in. The Black Wall offers a fine selection of multi-pitch trad routes that face east. The easiest route would appear to weigh-in at 5.10.  Good Evans is the classic line on the Black Wall.  Check out the Road Warrior for some sick off-width action. From the parking area at the lake, head north.

Rappel down the Black Wall via the standard rappel route which will bring you near the base of Good Evans.  From here, you will still need to get to the valley floor, which is another 200-300 feet down.  We downclimbed for a bit, then used a blue sling rap station to get to the bottom (200 foot rappel).  From here, scramble north (right) among the huge boulders, past The Rusty Dagger, Parallel Universe, and Espresso coming to the far right side near a broken up and grassy ledge/chimney section.  You will be able to see a pillar with white slings at the top.  This is the first pitch (at least, it's the one we did.  There are several other sets of slings further to the right--maybe variations or other climbs???)  Pitch 1 - Climb to the top of a pillar using a thin crack and face holds-belay out right.  5.9ish, 180-190 feet.  Per Greg Cameron: start on a highly-vegetated section of easy climbing. The original route went to the very top of this easy section to gain access to a left-slanting crack which is up and right of the first left-slanting crack system that you encounter. A rib of rock separates the two. If you do the crack on the left side of the rib (as a continuation of pitch 1), you will end up at the base of the overhanging 5.10+ fist crack described in the route description. Just past the overhang you merge with the actual route. If you do the crack on the right side of the rib, the description that I posted above (and Ken's original description) is relevant. The original route is much cleaner and a little easier.  Pitch 2 - Climb the overhanging fist crack out right--felt pretty hard 10+?--We belayed after the overhang.    Pitch 3 - Go up a left-angling crack system with many liebacks, 5.10.  Pitch 4 - Do more liebacking up the same crack system eventually working out right onto a small ledge,  5.10.  Pitch 5 - Climb another left-angling crack system with many liebacks (hard pitch 10+). Eventually pulling onto a large ledge with an 3 piton belay--pretty long pitch, 170-180 feet.    Pitch 6 - Climb through the soaking wet, heavily vegetated chimney, eventually stepping out left with some thin face climbing--set hanging belay.  The crux pitch?? Nothing felt harder than 5.9/10-, but it is very slick and loose, 130-150 feet.  Pitch 7 - Climb the left-angling crack for 15 feet (5.8) then do a foot traverse with disappearing hands for 15-20 more feet to a wet and vegetated crack that will lead you to the top with some scrambling, 60 feet total??   The old topo we had called this a 5 pitch route. It took us 7 pitches which all were long and strenuous.  Overall, it was a fun, adventurous day, but we felt it was much harder and more committing than Good Evans.

After passing some steep chimneys/gullies, start looking for a 2 bolt rap anchor at the edge of the wall (Black Wall).  You need to leave draws on these bolts and retrieve them when you are done.  Two 60m double rope raps are required.  The first rap puts on a small ledge and the second puts you just to the left of the route.  To start the route, locate a flake system that leads to a thin crack/seam.  Also, from the top of this flake system, the beautiful looking 4\" crack Road Warrior appears to the right.  P1 (crux)- start up the flakey features, moving upward and slightly right, passing a fixed pin and leading into a crack.  This crack narrows into a seam.  I promise that somewhere before the crux, a bomber #2 Rock can be placed. Continue to a small ledge system which jogs up and to the left towards some fixed anchors. This pitch is given 11a, but may be a hair easier.  P2 (9) - step a to the right from the belay and work yourself onto what can best be described as a really large flake (crux of P2).  At the top of this flake, move a few feet right to access a killer splitter system (8).  Most of this is around the 3.5 Friend size.  This pitch finishes in sort of a sheltered pod/alcove just above some blocky stuff and puts you at the base of a wide dihedral.  Use a 4 Camalot and big stopper for a bomber belay.  P3 (8) - continue up the wide dihedral and move right at its roof.  Move up and around right and into another good crack system (probably 3 - 3.5 Friends).  This ends at a small ledge and roughly a steep right-facing dihedral with a roof not too far above.  Carefully set an anchor as some of the rock is hollow sounding.  P4 (10/10+) - move upward to the roof in this steep section.  The climbing is very unique on this pitch.  It was a mixture of crack and face holds.  Pass a fixed pin before the roof.  At the roof, move left and around a corner to gain a small ledge with an old bolt to belay.  P5 (5.easy) - there are probably a few ways to gain the top (only about 30 or 40 vertical feet) from the end of P4.  I moved left and did a bit of traversing. Move upward where it looks easy. This seemed to be the path of least resistance during a good rain. This put me near a large flat boulder about 25 ft. behind the top of the cliff where I set my belay.  Additional Comments: As we began the 2nd pitch, it started to rain and continued for the rest of the route.  With the exception of the last pitch the route remained dry (or dry enough) to climb.  It is steep and protected by the roof near the top.  Be careful on the last pitch if it is wet - lots of traversing and not much gear.  This route was awesome and no one was on it but our 2 groups of 2.  At the top we saw a herd of mountain goats as a bonus. ',\n",

       " 'This route follows a bunch of cool features on the right side of the wall in an area that seems to be dry often. The style is varied though it requires a significant amount of crack climbing. As is standard on the Black Wall, the rock is fairly scaly in parts. Most of this comes off with traffic leaving behind perfect granite. The climbing is great, and as it sees more traffic, I think this route could become a classic. 3 bolts were added to protect the crux pitches in addition to 2 two-bolt belays (all 1/2 inch by 2 and 3/4 inch stainless steel bolts). All pitch lengths below are rough estimates:  Pitch 1: Follow the crack / corner up and right to lower angled terrain. Mostly just follow the path of least resistance. Belay on a ledge where the rock becomes more vertical and there are less grassy clumps. Gear belay (5.8, 100 feet).  Pitch 2: Start up the corner, and then after about 20-30 feet of climbing, head left on flakes. Climb up a big undercling / left-facing flake left of the main crack to a small ledge that joins the main crack. Belay here or go up 10 more feet to another ledge. Gear belay (11a, 70 feet).  Pitch 3: Follow the crack / corner up to the chimney feature and squeeze your way out the left side. Continue your way past bigger blocks that appear, and may be, somewhat loose. A couple more bouldery moves and you get to the big grassy ledge. Gear belay (10c, 160 feet).  Pitch 4: Climb the left-most crack in the corner for about 30-40 feet. Eventually trend right on cracks that lead up to the roof and follow juggy holds up and right around the roof and onto a small ledge. Gear belay (10c, 80 feet).  Pitch 5: Follow the crack in the corner via mostly easier climbing. Continue up to a small ledge. At this point, the corner continues to the left and a cool seam splits the bulge above. Follow some face moves out right to get into the seam and clip a bolt. Pull crux sloper moves through a bulge that leads to easier climbing up to a ledge. Bolt belay (12b, 100 feet).  Pitch 6: Move out right to enter a collection of flared cracks. Move past some decent gear and then up to a bolt. Continue up and slightly right to the big, horizontal ledge. Cut back left a bit through the roof to join the corner. Pull another smaller roof into the full corner and climb halfway up to a no-hands stem. Gear belay (12b, 60 feet).  Pitch 7: Continue up the corner and around to the left to a bouldery crux that lead up to horizontals. Follow the horizontals right to the arete. Make a long reach to clip the bolt and then follow the arete via slappy moves. Continue up the arete switching sides a couple of times until reaching a ledge just below the top of the cliff. Bolt belay (12a, 80 feet).  Pitch 8: Climb straight up through the roof if dry (5.10b). Otherwise climb out right through the easier weakness to gain the summit. There is a bolt belay on the short wall up and right (this is the top of Rainbow Highway). Bolt belay (10b, 30 feet).',\n",
       " \"This route was climbed as part of a near miss on Cary Granite.  Maurice's high point the lip of the roof and reached the sharp-edged, diagonal crack. But we did discover that doing the route labled 'A' on the topo was really nice.   Do the first pitch of Good Evans, 5.10+ route crux.  Steel nuts protect thin moves using black xenoliths and the seam.  This has excellent rock quality. Maybe it is only 5.8, A0 if you aid the short crux.  Do the second pitch of Cary Granite; 5.10 fingers-liebacking on beautiful, polished rock. Pass the point where Cary Granite takes a right.  End at the single-bolt & double pin rap anchor. Shown as red dots on the topo-image.   Maurice and I added in an extra pitch, and some 5.11-, by deviating onto Cary Granite.   The final pitch, 5.4, starts wide, even takes smaller gear, and is 5.8 only when wet.  Pass the two bolt rap station, ignore the tempting ledges, and stretch it to the top, 45 meters. The last move is also noted as 5.8 on the old topo, that's when wet. Nice 5.3 finish to the chains. A large stoppper and small sling thread help back up a more comfortable sitting belay, instead of hanging off the chains.\",\n",

Work your way up a crack system straight up from the belay to an awkward stance below a roof. Clip the first pin start pulling the roof, clip your second pin, and pull a large move to a jug.  Belay on a cozy ledge 5 feet from the rim.    This makes a much more enjoyable finish to Good Evans adding some awesome, steep, face climbing to the day!

       " \"Here's the description, I'll give my personal comments and more beta in a comment below:  Start on The Emerald Highway.  Pitch 1: start up a shallow, left-facing corner. After about 40 feet, it ends at a ledge. Above the ledge is an arch. Follow the arch to its apex, and face climb up to a small, bushy ledge above below another arch, 80 feet, 5.10+.   Pitch 2: climb straight up off the belay aiming for a bolt, just above a bulge created by the arch. After clipping the bolt, do a couple of moves up and then traverse left to another bolt. Gain a left-facing corner and continue up this to a 2 bolt anchor on a very nice ledge to the left. Pay close attention to gear through this section, it's there and it's good, 90 feet, 5.10-.  Pitch 3: climb up and right through a lower angle and vegetated section. You are aiming for the obvious, huge corner system above. Splitter cracks will appear on the left side. Climb the crack system to a 2 bolt belay at a stance on the right, 140 feet, 5.10.  Pitch 4: continue climbing up the huge dihedral above. This is a stellar pitch, combining various jamming techniques with liebacking, stemming, and face holds. Climb out the left side of a roof and continue up to a bolt on the left. Traverse left past the bolt and gain a nice ledge system and a 2 bolt belay, 120 feet, 5.10+.  Pitch 5: traverse left on the ledge system to a hand crack around the corner. Climb the crack (if you place gear here use a double runner)and follow the weakness back right into a left facing flake/crack. Continue up this feature to its top. Use awesome chickenheads (one is a 3 foot long tufa!) to ascend the blank face above. The face is protected by 2 bolts. Traverse back left on horizontals to a clean jam crack, which is ascended to yet another awesome belay stance with 2 bolts, 100 feet, 5.10-.  Pitch 6: climb the face above the belay on more cool chickenheads. Clip 2 bolts that lead you rightward to a series of angling seams. Follow these seams back up left to a small roof with an obvious break. Surmount the roof and clip a bolt. Traverse left on really cool features to gain a thin crack. Continue up the crack to a grassy ledge. Climb left of the crack up a large flake/block. At the left side of this (it's turned into a small ledge), climb up the short arete and gain another nice ledge and 2 bolt belay, 120 feet, 5.10+ (5.11-??).  Pitch 7: face climb straight up off the belay on smaller chickenheads and horizontals. Place gear in the horizontals! Gain a stance with a small roof above it. Climb right off the stance, up a short crack and break in the roof. Gain another stance/small ledge and traverse back left. Find gear in a crack, then reach up and yard on the obvious chickenhead jugs to gain the next ledge. Traverse right to a bolt, after climbing above this bolt head back left to another bolt and a bit of cool slabby climbing below a roof. Enter a very short chimney/cave and climb out its right side. A funky move onto a ledge followed by 1 more funky move onto the summit ledges. The anchor is 2 bolts and is back quite a ways from the edge, placed high on the next(short) section off cliff. Runner your gear well! 130 feet, 5.10-.\",\n",
       " \"This is a long offwidth route that will leave you gasping for air  at 13,000+ feet of elevation.  Much of the crack system is completely featureless on the outside with laybacking the positive edges the only possible respite from direct offwidthing.  Road Warrior ascends the left side of the Black Wall and shares three pitches with Good Evans.  Rappel from the first set of bolt anchors you come across when you reach the Black Wall.  After the second double rope rappel (might need new webbing), scramble downhill until you are standing in front of the wide, splitter crack.  Pitch 1:  We climbed the left-facing flake and crack system to its top, 5.7 100'.  Pitch 2:  Step left to the crack using a narrow foot ledge.  Climb the wide crack for over 100' to a belay ledge with a good bolt, fixed nut, and ring piton you probably don't want to tie into.  It is not a bad idea to have a large piece left for this belay, 5.10 110'.  Pitch 3:  Do more offwidthing through steeper but more featured rock.  The wide stuff ends and some seams and ledges lead up to a nice stance, 5.10 140'.  Pitch 4:  This is the same as Good Evans.  Climb up into the right-facing corner below the large roof past a couple pins and traverse out the left side of the overhang to an old bolt on a ledge.  5.10 50'.

       " 'See the topos.  To really do the Black Wall directly, one climbs either Parallel Universe or Rusty Dagger.  Wetness and blankness make Parallel hard to free.  Plenty of nice, dry, rain-sheltered, crack on the Dagger.  The line cuts through the center of the rotten, ach-forming, sector that undercuts the wall.  Some serious cleaning might create the most epic, smoker approachable, alpine trad-wall, in America. Until then read about \"red crud\" and other details in Andy Donson\\'s report; American Alpine Journal, 1999, pages 240-1.  It is doubtful that anyone else will want to claim a better free ascent.  Andy writes that he was past the crux, told Cameron \"it\\'s in the bag\", then pulled off a block on less critical terrain, which caused him to have to aid back up to his highpoint, because he was injured from the fall.

       " \"This is a very natural linkup of the harder climbing on Sinners on a Sunday and High Variance. P3 is likely the hardest lead, but P5 is more powerful.   It's a surprisingly warm section of the wall. The upper pitches go into the shade around 1:30 in August.  We climbed this link-up on 8/19/15 after sampling portions of both routes on 8/14/15.  Approach by rappelling down SOAS/Rainbow Highway. To find these raps, scramble down to the top of the buttress at the far end of the Black Wall. A two bolt anchor with silver chains on a roomy, grassy ledge marks the top. Four straightforward, half rope raps with a 70 meter rope on two bolt anchors leads to the base of P3. From there, another half rope rap gets you to a comfortable gear belay on a grassy ledge at the base of P2.  More details can be found under SOAS and HV, but here's what we found/thought:  P1. Climb grassy 5.8 to a gear belay below the big, left-facing corner (we skipped this pitch).  P2. Climb enjoyable 5.10- up the corner which leads to a three bolt traverse to the left. Climb over and clip the second bolt. Then traverse back right a foot or two and make a few difficult downclimbing moves that revolve around a positive left hand crimp. Stay low and traverse easily over to a two bolt anchor. Reach back and clip the third bolt for the second (the second needs to unclip the 2nd bolt before committing to the downclimb, but both leader and second are essentially on toprope for crux), 30 meters, 5.12/V5-ish.  P3. This is the best pitch on the route. It has 30 meters of good climbing with a definite crux past the bolt low on the pitch, 12c-ish.   Walk and scramble 20 meters left around the corner on a big, grassy ledge to a comfortable gear belay on its far left side.  P4. Head left into the big corner to join High Variance. Bob and weave awkwardly up the corner, past some wet bits, before hand traversing right to a small ledge at the base of a hanging corner, 25 meters, 5.10+ish. Make a gear belay.  P5. Awkward scabby 5.11- up the corner above, with a few more wet bits, leads to a ledge traverse to right. Place two critical small cams, and then do a V2/3-ish boulder problem up to a bolt. Then do a hard V5-ish boulder, to gain easier runout climbing to a comfortable ledge and two bolt anchor, 25 meters, 12c-ish PG-13.  The crux is spicy with the ledge so close to tricky, powerful climbing, and the belayer out of view. It is possible to continue up a wet 5.10 hand crack to the left and traverse easily over to the two bolt anchor if the 5.12 bit proves problematic.  P6. Scabby, endurance funk up some flared cracks past a bolt leads to jugs at a horizontal break. Traverse left a few feet, and make an awkward move up into a wide crack and a near no-hands rest. Continue up the steep corner above, before a final little crux that moves right to a gear belay at a horizontal crack, and small stance, 25 meters, 512b-ish.  (I believe we belayed a bit higher than Wilder, which accounts for the easier final pitch.)  P7. Clip a bolt just up and right from the anchor, and do some fun climbing up the arete past a mix of bolts and gear. Skip the two bolt anchor just below the rim, regain the first rap station, 30 meters, 5.11b-ish.  Big thanks to Matt, Dan, Scott, Greg, and Jackie for establishing these routes. They're good fun, and you can't beat the Black Wall's approach. However, I think the rock is generally too scabby for this linkup to be considered a classic. Perhaps with a lot more traffic things will clean up significantly.\",\n",
       " 'This route takes a line between Rainbow Highway and High Variance.  It is on excellent rock and generally protects quite well.  It shares the 3rd pitch of Rainbow Highway and the last 15 meters of High Variance.      Pitch 1. (5.9 PG-13, 55m)  You are aiming for a wide-looking crack to the right of the start of Coffee Achievers and High Variance.  At nearly the lowest point of the Black Wall, find a cairn and climb easy but interesting slab past a small flake with pro on its right side, up to a small roof that takes pro.  Continue straight up and then angle left on the path of least resistance to the base of a large flake.  This is somewhat runout slab and should probably be avoided if wet.  If wet, take the obvious 5.easy ramp/crack starting 20 meters left of the actual start up to the corner.  Climb the flake up and right into an overhanging corner and pull through on a thin hand crack.  Climb up and right to the anchors on pitch 2 of Rainbow Highway.    Pitch 2. (5.10 C0, 35m)  Climb pitch 3 of Rainbow Highway as follows: from the belay head up and right on grassy/slabby terrain to the corner. You are aiming for a handcrack and left-facing dihedral.  At the top of the dihedral, leave Rainbow Highway and traverse straight left on three bolts (C0) to a bolted anchor.  Unfortunately, the holds that previously enabled this traverse broke off.  It goes at C0.  Fortunately, the clean aid is only about 15 feet and is all on bolts.    Pitch 3. (5.12- or 5.11 C1, 35m) Climb the splitter finger crack for 35 meters.  Don\\xc2\\x92t take anything larger than a 0.75 on this pitch.  The difficulties start directly off the belay, with some tricky 5.11 finger crack.  After 5 meters, clip a bolt where the crack pinches to a seam and fire the crux (5.12-).  Alternatively, clip the bolt, place a piece or two, and aid the crux, which is relatively short (about 2-3 meters).  Then hold on for 25 meters of fantastic 5.11 fingers.  Belay at bolted anchors.  Pitch 4. (5.11+ or 5.10+, 35m)  Look directly up from the anchors and identify the large, left-facing weakness that goes through a wide-hands roof 25 meters up and to the left.  Climb off the belay up left on unprotected 5.8 slab to gain a grassy ledge, or go around the corner farther left and climb a crack that will accept gear.  Placing gear in the corner will significantly increase drag.  Traverse back right and test the first, left-trending flake you come to, and decide if you trust it for gear (note that the flake flexes but has not come off on multiple ascents - including some fairly intense prying to try and get it to come off).  Good gear can be had after the first 2 meters with supplemental gear available earlier in the Rainbow Highway corner to the right.  Continue climbing the corner up to the final, horizontal roof and make a choice.  Heading up and left through the roof is burly and incredibly exposed 5.11+ climbing with good protection.  The route originally went through the roof, but the hand-traverse right around to the face is also fantastic and goes at 5.10 (keeping the pitch at 5.10+).  In either case, belay at bolted anchors on the left side of the ar\\xc3\\xaate (hidden if you take the 5.10 exit).     Pitch 5. (5.11-, 35m) Take the obvious bolt line up 7 meters of slab, place pro, and pull through the roof.  After the roof, traverse left towards the ar\\xc3\\xaate and then continue up to a bolt.  Clip the bolt and pull up to an undercling (crux?), clip a bolt and pull through the second roof.  Rejoin the last 5 meters of Rainbow Highway and belay at that route\\xc2\\x92s bolted anchors.   Pitch 6. (5.11-, 25m)  From the Rainbow Highway anchors traverse 6-7 meters straight left on a grassy ledge.  Climb 3 meters up the face to gain a smaller ledge and continue left to the ar\\xc3\\xaate.  Climb the ar\\xc3\\xaate past a bolt, up to the roof, and bypass the roof on the left.  Climb the right side of a flake, clip a bolt, and climb the ar\\xc3\\xaate to the anchors of High Variance.  This pitch shares about 15 meters of the last pitch of High Variance.  A special thanks to Matt Wilder for allowing us to add the upper bolt to his route.  Pitch 7. (5.10, 10m)  Climb straight up through the roof if dry or climb out right through the easier weakness to the final anchors on Rainbow Highway.  This pitch is very short.',\n",
       " 'Start up Cannonball Corner and diverge as the topo shows.  Easy aid to the end of pitch two. There were some loose things that we may have skipped cleaning on the pitch two traverse because we were gunning for the top in one day.  This would all go free and be really nice, maybe 5.11, maybe harder with pump factored in to the rating.  It might be very tough to retreat from the end of pitch two.    The third pitch is outstanding.  Hands and fingers up to a great ledge. Might be just 5.9.  Like the good stuff on Cannonball, only thinner and thus \"better\".  I wrote \"dry bivvy\" on the topo, even though we got up in one day.  The important thing is that from the end of pitch one to the end of the crux aid the route stayed dry during a huge rainstorm.    Pitch four is an upside down rurp traverse.  Bad swing into the dihedral wall if it all rips, thus A4-. I don\\'t think anything ripped for the second, so maybe not too bad.  A rope left hanging from the top would perhaps be lasso-reachable for an insanely exposed, upward, jumar escape.    Our last pitch is also the last pitch of Cannonball.  Easier, unless it is wet and dark.   ',\n",
       " \"This is the free version of the aid route Undertow.  There are only a couple variations, one at the beginning, which avoids most (if not all) of Cannonball Corner by cutting right and mantelling up large ledges to a short handcrack.  The other variation is called the Undertoad Variation, which avoids the A4 roof by following an undercling/handcrack to the right out of the roof (instead of going left for the A4), pulling the lip, then making an unlikely traverse back left under another larger roof.  The following is from my post for Undertow after sending the route:  After two seasons of cleaning, replacing bolts, and fighting wetness in the later part of the alpine season, I was finally able to free this gorgeous line with Brad Wilson last Saturday (6/23/12), with both leader and follower freeing every pitch. The whole route is probably no harder than 5.11+, but as it is very sustained and at high elevation, it sometimes feels harder.   The majority of the route follows the aid line, except for half a pitch that completely avoids the A4- roof traverse. The rock has cleaned up well with maybe only a few suspect rocks that may come off with a crowbar. The climbing is tenuous, sustained, fairly sharp, and gear is sometimes tricky to place (a green/yellow Alien offset cam is really nice at the top of pitch 1!). However, the entire route takes great gear with clean falls, has no runouts, and sinker finger locks are to be had throughout. As Ken points out, even though the upper pitch is often wet, the rest of the route stays dry.    The pitches break down like this:  Pitch 1: 5.11- (130 feet). Start the route as Ken says on a ledge below the large dihedral of Cannonball Corner. Climb up easy ledges up and right to a small hand crack that leads you to the start of the main Undertow dihedral system. Clip a good piton and climb the sustained dihedral through some cool flakes (a green/yellow offset Alien is very helpful here) and up to a stance on a small ledge. The anchor takes finger-sized gear.   Pitch 2: 5.11+ (40 feet). This pitch could be combined with pitch 3. Continue up the dihedral (crux), pull around a small bulge to a ledge with a bolt. A finger-sized piece or two can back up the bolt.    Pitch 3: 5.11- (50 feet). Continue up the dihedral, past a thin flake that I couldn't pull off despite several attempts, and up into the 35 foot roof traverse (pumpy!). Belay at the lip on a small ledge. The anchor takes hand-size and small cams.    Pitch 4: 5.9 (110 feet). Climb straight up the fun hands and fingers corner to a good ledge. The anchor takes finger-sized cams.    Pitch 5: 5.11 (50 feet). The Undertoad Variation. Continue up the corner to the roof. This is where the original A4- traverses left under the roof. Instead, stay in the crack, which cuts through the right-side of the 10 foot roof. The lip of the roof is very sharp, so the trick is to back-clean as much as possible before the roof, and from a good stance under the roof, place one or two medium-sized cams in the middle of the roof on VERY long slings (we used 3 shoulder-length slings clipped together, which worked great). Undercling the roof to the right (avoiding the A4-), pull the lip, clip a fixed yellow Alien (the wires broke, so I couldn't get it out, but it's a good piece), and finally face climb a couple moves to the left under a massive shelf to an amazingly exposed, hanging, bolted belay on the ar\\xc3\\xaate.    Originally, I set a natural belay at the fixed yellow Alien, although this required the next pitch to traverse around the very sharp ar\\xc3\\xaate. Not only was this very dangerous, but it didn't allow the pitch to reach the summit. The face moves getting to the ar\\xc3\\xaate and keeping the rope off the sharp lip of the roof is the reason it's key to have the long slings under the roof. It was considered to place one or two bolts on the face to keep the rope off the sharp lip instead of the long slings under the roof; however, using the long slings was completely safe as you can get good gear in at the lip.    Pitch 6: 5.10 (70 feet). This is sometimes wet. Traverse left from the ar\\xc3\\xaate under the shelf for a few moves and join back with the original aid line. When the shelf becomes a manageable bulge, clip a high bolt and face climb up to the aid line belay ledge. Continue up past two more bolts to a big ledge, which is where the collected water drips from when it is wet. Climb up and right past a piton and finish in the chimney or on the ar\\xc3\\xaate to the left. Traverse left on big ledges to gain the summit and belay bolts.   A big thanks to Will Butler for conceiving of freeing this route and his hard work the last two seasons trying to make it safe and climbable.\",\n",

Strappo Hughes was first to finish the pitch using double-boots in winter.  Mello approach:  Use the Summit Lake gullies both in and out. Axe can be nice of snowfield.

       " \"A great deal of rock can be found along the Mount Evans road, Colo 103. The road follows Chicago Creek South to the Mount Evans drainage where the creek has carved its way through a great deal of granite. While much of the rock along Chicago Creek is unappealing high altitude granite, like Mt Evans itself some of crags along Colo 103 are composed of superb stone. The Chicago Creek Rock is one of the better crags along the creek and it is composed of bullet-proof stone equal to the best granite in the state. The best lines on the crag are largely South facing and get good sun through mid afternoon. CCR appears to host numerous short cracks and trad protected face routes, and climbing on the crag dates back to some indeterminate point when it was not so kitch to make up climbing guides and record every ascent - so most of this information is probably lost to history. For example, we located some natty old gear in a very pretty crack, but couldn't guess how far back the ascent might date, nor could we even guess who may have climbed it. Two bolt protected face routes (5.10 & 5.12) were installed in January of 2003 taking the main, blank plate that faces due South. These both ascend brilliant rock that is well featured and solid. Climbing on these two routes follows a system of roofs and edges along light, chocolate colored stone. Overall it is hard to gauge how many routes have been done on CCR, but at least a dozen good lines are apparent from our initial inspection. Some of the crack routes appear to have been cleaned up by unknown parties, while others seem to be just waiting for someone to climb them. Difficulty would likely span from quite moderate to 5.12 or harder. The mountian setting, although within sight of Colo 103, is still serene, out in the woods, and well worth a visit on a warm summer day. \",\n",

I rope-soloed the FA, and feel the name is accurate. It's not much to look at, but the exposure is decent. To get to the base of the route, follow the directions as for Bada Bing and Bada Boom. After you cross the steel bridge, bare to the right and head uphill until you are at the base of the obvious nose, near a telephone pole. The first pitch, if you want to call it that, starts up the ramp to the left (5.0 slab). You can probably solo/scramble up this.

You will begin up just to the right of the most vertical section of the wall and directly below an orange lichen colored roof. The first 15 feet of this pitch is on bomber, knobby granite, then it shifts right to avoid a slight roof, moving diagonally up across some loose blocks. Be gentle on this section, and continue up to the second belay, situated in an obvious alcove right under the orange lichen covered roof. You'll find a fixed piton. From here, pull up and left over the roof(careful, it's covered in lichen) onto a small grassy ledge, and continue up to the top on easy ground. See pic for location of rap rings, or walk off.\",\n",

GCC rock is typical of most alpine granite in the area, but it is not as uniformly bullet-proof as as some of the best Mt. Evans rock. Nonetheless, the routes are good to excellent, albeit a bit sharp on the fingers. GCC is largely South-facing and gets good sun most of the day.

Per Ken Trout: This granitic cliff may become famous someday as the highest altitude almost-roadside-crag on the continent. The slabs overlook Lincoln Lake and are just below the Mt. Evans Road; a pleasant alternative to the gnarly Black Wall.  During the hot summer of 2012, a lot of new routes were developed.  Most of the slabs are inside a wilderness boundary.  Any drilling should be done by hand.  The slabs get sun in the morning and can feel a little warm when temperature climbs to 100+F in Denver.  The afternoon shade can feel wonderfully cold when the heat is on.  If the weather is not stormy, then after-work ascents are possible.  It is about 90 minutes of driving from downtown Denver.      The Lincoln Lake Apron (5.7+) and Jabba (5.11-) probably have the best rock.     The cracks had been kept somewhat secret for several decades because there are a lot of columbine flowers at the base.  Please tread carefully and keep the dog tied up tight.

Pitch one is only 30 meters long and ends at a nice ledge with two bolts.  Start up a thin crack, step right to another thin seam that dead-ends, and then move left to a corner.

Pitch two has a tricky step left to change cracks.  There is a two bolt anchor on a dike foothold at 30 meters, handy for escaping storms. Or just use one of the bolts for pro and keep going up a beautiful dike to the top.  Near the top, the nice holds thin out and the rock gets crumbly, but a bolt protects that bit. There is a third bolted rap anchor at the top of the slab.  Alternatively, you can belay off fat-finger-sized cams up left on a nice ledge.  4TH CLASS TO THE TOP       First ascent.

Numerous world-class blocks litter the sprawling slopes of Colorado\\xc2\\x92s most accessible 14-er, and if not for a grueling, \\xc2\\x91never-again\\xc2\\x92 approach, this would be one of the most popular boulder fields in Colorado.  The rock is stellar, highly featured granite, with excellent, rough texture, numerous incut edges, and the odd Tuolumne-esque knob.    Though the quality of the climbing is undeniable, there are numerous drawbacks.  The approach is truly heinous for the most accessible boulders, and gets worse for the more remote areas.  All of the blocks are situated over 10\\xc2\\x92000 feet (some higher), which makes the climbing season tragically short.  Even during the peak summer season, days are often cut short by sudden thunderstorms, high winds, and snowfall.  The sun is intense and the air is thin.  Any injury is potentially serious as help is far away and retreat is long & involved.  Mosquitoes and other pests are ubiquitous.  There are numerous distinct bouldering areas scattered across the slopes of the mountain, with the most popular being those along the Chicago Lakes Basin, a beautiful glacial valley northeast of the summit.  Creatively named Area A, Area B, Area C & Area D, these areas are the most accessible and offer the bulk of the developed boulders.  Most of the well-known problems, such as the Dali, Gorillas in the Mist, All Dogs Go to Evans, and Timeline, are found in Areas A & B.  Excellent problems can also be found at Lincoln Lake, which is south of the paved highway CO-5.  The vast majority of the boulders are located within the Mount Evans Wilderness Area.  Please read the access bulletin and abide by the instructions.  This is an alpine environment!

This is trad climbing at its best - similar to the Black Wall, only bigger (800 - 900 feet high).  The classic route is Roofer Madness, an 8 pitch 5.11b route that ascends an obvious buttress with a huge roof about midway up.  The best approach is to descend the Black Wall via rappel and then scramble down and east to the north-facing aprons that constitute the lower part of the wall.  ',\n",
       " \"Roofer Madness is the biggest route in the Black Wall area. It ascends the beautiful, north-facing buttress that can be seen from the top of the Black Wall when looking southeast.  In fact, most of the route can be seen from this vantage.  The route was partly cleaned on rappel in 1990 (only the first two pitches) and both the 1st and most of the 2nd halves of the route were climbed by Greg Cameron and Clare Dunning prior to the first bottom to top ascent by Cameron and Lowe in 1991 or 1992.   The upper half of the climb, beginning with the crux pitch, can be accessed by descending down 3rd and 4th class grassy ledges from the southeast and then traversing right (5th class) immediately beneath the lower of the two huge roofs.  This is a good strategy on a day in which rain is expected early.  This part of the climb faces west.  The lower cracks (which face north) may have filled back up with dirt and moss since the 1990 cleaning. This is a great climb that as of 2005 is probably still awaiting a second ascent.  The recommended access is via rappel down the Black Wall and then scrambling on scree to the prominent north-facing apron that forms the beginning of the buttress. This allows you to see the route before climbing it. An alternate access is to hike north into the Chicago Lakes Valley from the overlook at Summit Lake and then hike north-northwest along the base of the cirque to the buttress.  Start in a hand and fist crack, situated in the middle of the apron that forms the bottom of the Roofer Madness buttress.You are in the right place if you see two huge roofs looming a few hundred feet above you, one directly on the prow, and a higher one just on the right side of the prow.  P1).  (150 feet, 5.10).  Follow the hand and fist crack up and left past a grassy depression.  The crack thins to fingers and, after another 30 feet or so, a branch of the crack goes straight up for another 80 feet to a small ledge.  This crack involved a fair amount of cleaning prior to and during the first ascent.  This pitch can be done in two shorter pitches, with a natural belay ledge just above the branch.  P2).  Follow the finger crack up and a bit left to a blackish-colored slot, which is the continuation of a prominent right-facing dihedral that begins at the base of the buttress.  Ascend the slot (5.9 - 5.10), and find a belay stance (~80-foot pitch).  P3).  Work up easier ground, staying on the left side of the prow, to the left side of a large roof.  When nearly even with the roof, traverse straight right along a prominent, horizontal fracture system to a ledge.  At this point you are on the right side of the prow and about 80 feet beneath a huge roof with a crack that branches into two after about 15 feet.  P4). Ascend the rightmost crack (hand and fingers, 5.11b, crux) to a hanging belay immediately beneath the roof.  If feeling particularly strong, this pitch and the next can be done as one.  P5).  This is the defining pitch of the climb.  Follow the (now) wide crack up and right and through the roof (5.11a, scary) to a very exposed belay on the right side of the prow.  There is one fixed pin on this pitch as well as a pin at the belay.  Note that this pitch can be wet at times.  P6).  Work up and a bit right past three horizontal fractures to a decent ledge below a roof (5.9? - I really can't remember).  P7).  Traverse left along the ledge and then up a crack and through two roof systems (5.10?) to a prominent, horizontal fracture system laced with ledges.  P8).

       " \"Telluride is surrounded by thirteeners and four fourteeners with a plethora of technical options that can be ascended year round.  The San Juans are the 'freshest' mountain range in the US (newest geologically), and the rock quality is generally chossy everywhere.  Once the angle rears up to near vertical, however, the rock improves to a point of taking gear you can trust.  Alpine routes are best climbed when ice is present for protection and to hold the choss together, but most can be climbed year round.  Lots of alpine ice forms in the fall and spring.  Many, many accidents and deaths have occurred to hikers on the local 14ers due to rockfall.  Full winter ascents are rare and skis are almost required.  The remoteness of these routes compromises rescue severely.  It's best not to trust your gear, ever (don't plan on rappel descents or pushing yourself); however, the technical standard in the entire area is generally low (5.5-5.8, AI3-4).  There are traverses aplenty, and most peaks can be descended with low grade downclimbing if not hiking by the hiking routes.  Other hiking sites are sources of beta (13ers.com, 14ers.com, summitpost.com as well as the local guide service in town).  Almost all of the technical routes are at the tops of the peaks which means long approaches and plenty of scrambling in and out.  Trails crisscross everywhere and the majority of routes around Telluride can be climbed in a long day.  Camping is free in the National Forest for 14 days per location.  With the exception of the 'hiking' routes on the local 14ers, it is unlikely to encounter others.  I say 'hiking' because the standard routes to summits require plenty of 4th class and sometimes low 5th class on loose rock with high exposure and high consequences. \",\n",
       " \"Gladstone Peak is seldom climbed due to its proximity to three 14ers and loose rock (though all the rock in the area is loose). The standard route and easiest descent is the North Ridge. The upper third of the North Ridge is somewhat stout for a 'hike' (upper fourth class, maybe low grade fifth class). It is steep and loose; vigilance is prudent; I would not climb below others. As with other peaks in the area, once the angle rears to near vertical, the rock quality improves to accept gear. The East Ridge has been ascended at low fifth class. The West ridge would appear to connect to Mount Wilson but does not (perhaps a worthy outing - an ascent of the West ridge).   A fourth class pass exists between Gladstone Peak and Mount Wilson. The South ridge connects to Cross Mountain but has many difficult looking gendarmes and would seem to be untraversable. Neither the West or South ridges have recorded ascents. A large snowfield exists below the North face most all year long, no known routes on the North face, but it looks as if potential exists in three large, north-facing corners. The South face is quite intriguing from the summit of Mount Wilson, though no trails access the area south of Gladstone Peak.\",\n",

Mears has a rather distinctive summit when viewed from the north from Dallas Divide on HI62.  The view from the south is blocked by Iron Mountain and Campbell Peak from the south until you are sufficiently high enough on the Telluride Ski Area.  The summit is a rounded, symmetrical M-shape, the east summit being the high point.  Like all of the peaks in the area, Mears is loose.  Use caution.

       " \"This route ascends the East face of the North Ridge for the lower 2/3 before gaining and climbing the North Ridge. From afar, the line of ascent appears to be sustained steepness; however, it is quite stepped, and the climbing really begins once you gain the North Ridge proper at a point four pitches or so below the summit.  This is the obvious line of least resistance once you get into it, and route-finding is relatively straightforward.    Section 1: Ascend the steep and wide scree gully just to the east of the ridgeline.  The top of the gully is a nearly vertical wall of scree, much like a scree cornice.  This can be ascended on the left or right side.  The gully tops out on an expansive, flat, scree plateau below the north face, ~600 feet.  Section 2: Cross the scree plateau maintaining a line close to the huge towers which form the ridgeline proper.  Section 3:  A narrow scree gully between loose pillars provides access through the next rock band to the vegetated shelf above, ~300 feet.  Ascend to the left across the vegetated shelf towards the summit pyramid on small, steep gullies and rock steps maintaining the line of least resistance and the most solid rock.  You are ascending up and across the face that forms the east side of the North Ridge on steps of semi-solid rock that are covered with loose scree, with stretches of steep scree between: high consequence fourth class with some very low fifth class moves thrown in.  From this point on, you are more or less committed to the summit.  No options for protection or rappel anchors exist, and downclimbing would be very difficult and dangerous.  Aim for a lower angled patch of red scree on the North Ridge proper at the base of the summit pyramid.  A huge tower is visible above which blocks access up the ridgeline.  This tower will be bypassed on its right (west) side, ~600 feet, 4th Class.  Section 4: Enter the maze.  You are on the ridgeline proper atop the red scree slope on a shoulder below the summit pyramid.  Escape down  the west side of the North Ridge is not possible.  From here, you cross slightly over to the west side of the ridgeline to bypass a huge gendarme and ascend the dubious-looking summit pyramid via a series of steep, rock-filled chimneys.  A few small chockstones block the way.  This is the technical crux of the route (5.6).  It may be possible at this point to rope up, though be very careful to keep yourself and the rope out of the way of rocks knocked down by the leader and the rope.  A fall would not be clean and your gear may pull rocks down onto you.  Meander up through steep steps and climb three near-vertical, approximately 100 foot chimneys on the broad 'ridgeline' to the skyline above, ~300 feet.  Section 5: You are out of the steep chimneys and back onto the ridgeline proper.  The West ridge is visible a couple of hundred feet to the south and is the easiest line to the summit.

The couloir will bend hard left and become very inset into the face. Several near vertical WI3/M3 steps mark the cruxes of this couloir, and do not be enticed into following other chutes that branch off from the main couloir.

In the summer, you can count on about an hour per peak once you have gained the skyline.

There is a real old mining spike in an unlikely saddle on the ridge, which is Badass to've placed. The ridgeline up to Peak 13,242 is also problematic and requires some meandering and steep loose climbing.  Low fifth class.  The ridgeline widens considerably and it is a quick and very pleasant stroll over Peaks 13,369; 13,463 and 13,337 to Mendoza Peak (13,275'). Of the Second Class.  Saint Sophia Ridge is untraversed in its entirety.  This is obviously the crux of Section A.  Climb around, over, and through the many spires along the ridge on exposed choss.  Struggle to a point halfway along and the low spot in the ridge; there is a steep, skinny chimney on the right that can be downclimbed east to a scree shelf.  Many of these exits exist along the way to the east.  The whole of St Sophia Ridge can be bypassed via a scree shelf on the Governor Basin side.  Traverse the scree shelf north and climb Mount Emma (13,581') via scree gullies.  There is a large flat-topped buttress along the ridge to Emma from the southeast that can be walked around rather than climbed over.  Fifth class.  Eight thirteeners total.  Continue on with Section B to Gilpin Peak or descend the West ridge of Emma to the Sneffels Highline Trail (fourth class).  It is also possible to descend the Southwest ridge of Emma and climb Greenback Mountain (12,997'), and descend to town from there. Fourth class.  Blocktop Mtn (beyond Gilpin) seems to be the crux and ceases progression towards Dallas. A natural and fun addition to these peaks is continuing over Gilpin (bypass major cliffband on left side) and climbing Sneffels along the ridge from Gilpin, which is very high quality.\",\n",

The sub-summit is connected to Wilson Peak's East ridge via a long, swooping, 3rd class ridgeline. The top of the north face of the sub-summit is a steep and loose headwall. This is the easiest line up the north face of the sub-summit(13,013'); it follows the extreme left side of this small face.   The NNE ridge is most easily gained by skirting initial difficulties to their right up red scree. At the top of the red scree, trend back left through a weakness in the headwall to gain the ridge proper. A short stretch of vertical, loose 5.5 rock gains the ridge.   From this point, follow the knife-edged ridge with maximum exposure to the sub-summit. The section from red scree to sub-summit (13,013') presents the technical and psychological cruxes of the route. The rock is very loose and does not present the opportunity to place gear. Do not loosen rocks onto your partner. The ridge traverse to the sub-summit is very narrow with high consequences, though technically very low fifth-class and fourth-class terrain. Solo or simul-solo with great vigilance and care.   From the sub-summit, stroll across the swooping ridge to gain Wilson Peak's East ridge.   A large notch halts progress at the base of the main summit pyramid. Downclimb left (south) into the notch, cross through right (north) to the north face and up a rock couloir (which may contain ice depending on conditions) to regain the East ridge proper.

The best variation is to take the left hand split, about half way up, just past a large rock tower on the right.  The left hand couloir necks down and gets a little bit steeper (65 to 70 degrees) before finishing just below the summit.  Alternately, climb straight up the couloir to the west ridge and scramble up to the summit.  Descend as for Pacific Peak, down the east ridge.  Overall, either couloir is probably about 1000 feet long.   This route is in condition, probably most of the year.  Beware of serious cornices on the west ridge above the route.  Stone fall is also present as well.  In spring, this is primarily a snow climb.  By late summer, the left-hand couloir will melt out, necessitating some easy 5th class climbing on the side. ',\n",

       " \"The Northeast Ridge is the standard summit route for Pyramid Peak.  Like all routes on Pyramid, there is plenty of loose rock and tricky route finding; however, for competent rock climbers, this is an easy scramble.  If you follow your nose and stay on route, the route is fairly tame.    This is a fairly short climb, by 14er standards, only about 8 miles of hiking round-trip; however, there is a great deal of scree & talus hopping, making progrss slow & tedious.  This is an alpine summit, so be prepared to deal with altitude, extreme weather, etc.  Begin at Maroon Lake, ~10 miles SW of Aspen.  Follow the trail towards Crater Lake, for ~ 1 mile.  The trail heads along Maroon Lake, then up a steep hill in the woods.  The trail pops out of the woods, and follows a classic moraine for several hundred yards.  After ~30 minutes (from the parking lot) there is an enormous cairn on the left marking the new trail to Pyramid Peak.  Turn left and follow this trail.   The Pyramid Peak trail begins fairly flat, heading SE across the ancient glacial valley.  After ~ 5 minutes, the trail hits the valley wall and begins switchbacking up the steep slope.  The trail crosses a number talus fields on its way up to the North Face Cirque.  After about 30 minutes of steep hiking, the trail ends at the mouth of an enormous talus filled cirque.  This is the North Face Cirque.  The impressive N face of pyramid is visible.    Hike due south into the cirque, which probaly has some snow fields.  Follow the snow where its safe to do so, otherwise hug the right side of the cirque, following an intermittent cairned trail.  After a tedious, steep climb up, a broad plateau is reached, just below the N Face.  The NW Ridge splits off here.  For the NE ridge, head L (WSW), hopping talus across the basin, aiming for the west wall of the cirque.  Likely the least pleasant section of the route climbs the steep west wall of the cirque via a series of scree-filled couloirs.  There is a well beaten trail leading to the correct couloir, and there should be a number of large cairns.  Follow this couloir to about half-way up the face, then traverse up & right to the next couloir, which is followed to the top of the wall, to the Northeast Ridge.  There is plenty of loose rock in this couloir, so wear a helmet and take care not to knock rocks down on climbers below.  Once atop the wall, follow the Northeast Ridge towards the summit.  This route is well cairned, and well-beaten.  If you find yourself on untrampled ground, you are off-route.  The first section of the ridge climbs more or less directly on the ridge, with a few short diversions onto the N (right) side of the ridge.  Eventually the route turns to the S side of the ridge, and from this point stays to the S pretty much until the summit.  The route winds up and down, left & right.  Follow your nose, and don't climb over any loose rock.  The correct route is totally solid and not sketchy.  There are a few key points where down-climbing is required to stay on the best rock, so look down if you don't see the obvious route.  There are a number of short, fun, 4th class boulder problems on good rock that will be required to surmount various rock steps.\",\n",
       " '\\tThis route is a very fun alpine climb which features elaborate views of the Maroon Bells.  Start from the Maroon Lake trailhead, and hike west for about one mile until you encounter in a small, faint boulder field.  From here, hike south-south east to a steep hill leading into Pyramid\\'s north face  basin. There are two \"notches\" that are a possibility when hiking up to this basin, and you want to chose the one on the left (east).  Once you have hiked into this basin, you will then hike up a steep hill on the right to gain the northwest ridge.  Again, there will appear to be two possibilities when trying to scramble to the northwest ridge.  You will want to climb up the one closest (northern most of the two) up to the northwest ridge saddle.  Then you will reach a false ridge, and from here you will want to traverse west to the real northwest ridge on Pyramid (class 3). \\tOnce you have gained the ridge, hike on the west side of ridge until reaching a faint, but medium sized, rocky couloir.  Climb 1/3rd to midway of the way up this couloir, and then traverse west under a large, dominate cliff band.Traverse until you have reached the bottom of a very narrow gully.  Climb the gully.There will then be a series of narrow gullies; when you reach the top of one you will traverse west (right) until you reach the bottom of another one.  \\tEventually you will reach the top of the northwest ridge.  At this point climb southwest until reaching a very dominate bowl, at the top of a large couloir.  Traverse the top of this bowl to reach the south ridge.  Once reaching the ridge, climb a steep cliff band on the ridge.  Walk to the summit.  Most of the climbing is class 3 with an occasional class 4 move.  The cruxes are in the first initial narrow gully, and on the steep cliff band leading to the summit on the south ridge.  Enjoy, and wear a helmet! ',\n",

       " 'Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) needs little introduction as one of the most beautiful national parks in the U.S.  Consequentially it has some of the most beautiful climbing in the U.S.  The routes here are long, (grade III to V), committing, usually have some sections of loose rock, require a lengthy hike in, require some knowledge of snow travel, and are absolutely spectacular.  In short, you need to be a competent climber to safely enjoy this area.  Climbing in the park is a complex endeavor that requires being able to analyze many different objective hazards, all while sucking air at 12-14000 feet.  These hazards include loose rock, bad weather, bad pro, etc. all of which are magnified in this alpine setting.  A first-time climber in the park should feel competent at leading trad at the very least a grade harder; probably two or three than the climb they wish to tackle.  One should have a good deal experience on multi-pitch climbs, and one should feel in shape enough to hike five miles uphill in the dark and then climb a thousand-foot face.  All this said, the climbs are magnificent and unforgettable.  Some good introductory routes would include the North Ridge of Spearhead (5.6), the Northeast Ridge on Sharkstooth (5.6), or even the East Gully on Sharkstooth (5.4 and NOT a chosspile, a really good climb).  A step up from these routes would include the South Face of the Petit Grepon (5.8, with a time-consuming descent), the magnificent Culp-Bossier on Hallett (5.8+, runout 5.7).  Climbing in the park really starts to open up in the 5.9 and 5.10 range.  In the 5.9 range, Syke\\'s Sickle (9+++, (7s)), the steep Hesse-Ferguson on Hallett (5.9 with low dihedral variation is in my opinion the best route on Hallett), and the Direct South Ridge of Notchtop (9) all offer spectacular and incomparable climbing.  In the 5.10 range you can\\'t beat the Casual Route on Long\\'s (10a), but there are other stellar 10s in the park.  Chasm View Wall offers some spicy routes, and Spearhead has a couple classic 10s (The Barb and Age Axe?) with The Barb having a reputation as an \"easy\" 10.  The Yellow Wall on the Diamond is 10c if done with the Forrest Finish variation, and is possibly the most spectacular route I have ever done. Pervertical Sanctuary (10+) is also apparently totally classic.  I have yet to venture into 5.11 and 5.12 range in the park, but two routes come to mind as totally classic, these are D7 on the Diamond (11c) and Birds of Fire on Chiefshead (11a). There are tons of other routes in the park, some suck, others are hidden gems. Exploring the more obscure routes is part of the fun of park climbing.FWIW, if you are trying to enter during entrance fee collecting times, you can use the right lane at the Beaver Meadows entrance with the card activated gate bypassing the lines with a Rocky Mountain National Park annual pass OR a National Parks annual pass purchase at RMNP!',\n",

Move R and up, then angle left to the dihedral/chimney.  Continue up to a ledge with a #3 Camalot slot above.  You are just short of a few short trees here.  Beware of rope drag.  5.6, 200 feet.  P2.  Traverse right briefly, head up before you get to a tree, angle R up the dihedral/chimney or slab on the R.  Belay in the chimney or link the next bit.  5.6, 150 feet.  P3.  Work up the chimney.  There are optional #4 & 5 Camalot slots in here.  Rope drag exiting this chimney require a belay here.  There is a perfect #11 hex slot and black (0.33) Alien slot for the belay.  5.6, 40feet.  P4.  Here comes the exposure.  Move up the dihedral for perhaps the crux moves, move R below a large block and jam the crack with stems out L.  Briefly move to the L crack and back R.  Gain a stance.  Move up to a large ledge.  Beware of a precarious block hanging off this ledge.  You could link the next pitch.  5.7+, 120 feet?  P5.  Chimney facing R up this large slot.  Many moves can be done sans hands and no offwidth moves are required.  However beware of objects hanging off your back like camelbacks, cams.  Small pro plus a #4 Camalot.  There is another loose block R and below the \"chockstone\".  Encounter a mini-forest and belay.  5.7, 40-120 feet depending on your belay tree.  If anyone has done the upper chimneys, please post & we can incorporate the info into the description.  From here, you can see the wall could continue up perhaps 3 pitches or more chimneys to the right.  If you\\'ve been chimneyed out use the descent described here.    Descent:  Traverse on a treed/shrubbed ledge left perhaps 300 yards to an obvious scree/boulder slope and head for Lake of Glass.  Do not cut off early or risk being cliffed.',\n",
       " \"Route-finding is vague, protection dicey in places (in fact nearly everywhere) but this is a great line up a  proud buttress; actually one of the tallest and best-looking buttresses in the whole RMNP. In addition, this route has a fairly short approach, (you can watch all  the bumblies heading up for the Petit Grepon) and best of all a solid southern exposure; you may end up lost and frightened and unable to retreat, but at least you'll be nice and warm.  P1. The first pitch is obvious and easy, up a chimney/crack/slab to a large ledge.  P2-3. The next two pitches are pretty indeterminate but basically take you into the obvious, huge, shallow dihedral/groove way up and right. Check out Rossiter's High Peaks book for more details. The climbing on pitch two, as I recall is pretty runout, vertical 5.8 mostly on great jugs (but worryingly above the large belay ledge), requiring some care with navigation (lest you end up on much harder ground). This is like the best of the Petit Grepon climbing, but steeper (and definitely no crowds). Once in the long dihedral, you may expect that there'd be lots of yummy gear in the crack in the back, but alas this is not the case. . . . Luckily the stone is immmaculate. Anyway, follow the dihedral to the top of the huge pillar.  Even here the gear is not so easy to find.  P4. From here, various ways tackle the imposing headwall. Apparently one can go straight up. Good luck. I led out to the right, until I gained a ledge about thirty feet away. Very exposed here! A coffin-sized/shaped block sits on this small ledge.  P5. From here, a nice but short crack leads to some loose-looking blocks. Angle rightwards to avoid the blocks (I recall a very welcome #1.5 Friend somewhere here in a slot), and wander upwards (butt-clenching exposure!) upwards to finally pull onto the shoulder.  P6. One more pitch, easy, from here to the real summit.  Six looooong pitches, continuously absorbing, with a serious feel; one of the coolest routes I've done in the Park.\",\n",
       " \"This is a good route in a great setting, but I was disappointed that the it didn't break left onto the red rock at the top.  The top pitch is blocky with big, classic features in an open, chimney-like system.\",\n",
       " \"Cathedral Wall is similar in nature to Hallett but is often steeper, more runout and sees little or no traffic.   Keep in mind the three stars I gave this route is on the Cathedral wall quality scale. So, don't expect a Culp-Bossier or a Syke's Sickle. However, DO expect a super, steep route that will always have you on your toes and wondering where the hell to go next.   The Rossiter guide seemed to have a fairly accurate topo for this route, and don't forget the trusty 60m rope to link a few of the pitches.   I still can't believe Kor sent those runouts in his natty old hiking boots! What a bad ass.  Per PatrickV:  For those wanting to avoid the 5.9x terrain that lurks about, read further.  The Rossiter topo shows pretty accurately how to get to the base, look for a large, right-facing dihedral about two pitches up that is about 100 feet long and capped with a small ledge with some Bonsai type trees. The climb starts in the obvious weakness/dihedral leading up to this larger dihedral.  P1. 5.6 lead up and left over an easy face and ledge into the base of the smaller, right-facing dihedral system that leads up to the base of the large dihedral, belay once the dihedral system is reached. This is a short 40 foot pitch.   P2. Go up the dihedral system until at the base of the large, landmark, open-book dihedral. 5.8 and a little loose.  P3. Take the intermittent finger crack in the left wall of the large, open-book dihedral almost to the top, and when it starts to peter out step right into the dihedral proper and follow it to a cramped tree filled ledge, 5.9+ and the best pitch on the route.  P4. Above the ledge is a small, white, right-arching arch with thin gear, surmount this (5.8), and once above move over the easy runout Culp-Bossier style face (5.6/5.7) to the left and then straight up to a ledge system. Just above this ledge system is a 40-foot, left-facing, open-book dihedral with a ledge at the base, belay here (I seem to remember some pins here), 5.8.   P5. this is where the climb starts to get more serious, looking back on it I think we were off route on this pitch, so take the description with a grain of salt. Move up the dihedral on 5.9 terrain with several fixed pins climbing a crack in the left wall of the dihedral. After about 50 feet, I reached an obvious balancy no hands traverse left.   Now you are headed for a stance at the base of an obvious, right-facing dihedral capped by a blackish roof that you have to undercling (this is the next pitch). The guidebook says to look for a roof to surmount off the traverse ledge on jugs, but the closest I came was a small overlap (not a roof at all) about 60 feet out with some jugs above it. My last piece was a good cam 25 feet to the right on the ledge, I placed a sling around a horn (which protected the moves off the ledge, but it promptly came off when I was above it) and pulled some 5.8 moves on jugs to a stance about twenty feet of the ledge. The only gear here was a smallish 3 or 4 RP in a good placement. I traversed up and left on licheny mildy loose faceclimbing with some off balance .8+ face moves a good 15 to twenty feet above the rp to reach the stance at the bas of the dihedral on the next pitch. This pitch was exciting to say the least, 5.8+R/X (if the RP breaks, it is 50 ledgy feet to your next piece), but I think there is an easier way to do it, perhaps further to the left.  P6. climb up the licheny but cool dihedral and undercling right around the roof (5.9), and make sure you head right instead of following the incipient crack straight up. I believe there is a good belay out right after this roof. For I went straight up the incipient crack and could only get a marginal hanging belay.   P7. for the next pitch, I led up and left on crappy rock below a left-angling roof system towards the now close arete. This pitch was definitely off route with scrappy 5.9X moves protected by psychological pro (I left a blue TCU and RP which are probably still there luring people off route) and a marginal belay. The arete which I turned to the left of the roofs via a .10a move (also poorly protected). Later, I found good gear and lowered to the belay.   The real route goes out right through a small roof on standard, alpine runout 5.8R terrain up into a large, right-facing dihedral which ends at a massive ledge. Above this ledge is 150 feet of easy 5.6 to the top of the wall. Head up and to the left (west-ish) around the cliffs at the top to get on the easy west trending ridge that leads to the Petit and Sharkstooth. Search around for the right descent gully and gain the Andrews Glacier trail.   This route is a great adventure route on one of the most adventurous walls in the par. It has the potential to lure the climber into some truly scary terrain. Keep your head about you, and you'll find your way up, a reasonable route does exist through all those roofs. You will also have a true apprectiation of Kor's abillities once it is all over. It has a short approach, too.  Per Henry Lester: Here are some additions/corrections to Pat Vernon's description that will help anyone using these comments and description.  Pitch 5: Above the grassy ledge there is a large sloping ledge (with some fixed gear); there are two corners above; the larger one faces left and a smaller one faces right. Climb the right-facing corner; this leads to a 1 to 2 foot ledge. There is an old pin in a flake; as you move left on the ledge you can put a large cam(s) into the crack formed by the ledge and the wall. As you move left along the ledge, you will come to a point where the ledge pinches down; carefully traverse past this point. Now you are directly below the black roofs and the corner leading into them. Move up on a large handle hold and with a little difficulty get stood up on the hold. There is an old style #1.5 Friend placement on the right in a shallow horizontal slot; move a little higher to good RP placements; the anchors are 10 feet above.  Pitch 6: up the corner and around the overhangs. We belayed out right as suggested. It is OK but requires some of the same gear as the pitch. In retrospect, I think the small crack above the right side of the overhang would be satisfactory. The route then goes up right of this crack or, if you belay out right, straight up. Straight up is 5.7 onto a sloping ledge at the base of a short, right-facing corner. Go up the corner and out around the left side. Move up and left on thin cracks with small pro. You will see the exit dihedral above.\",\n",
       " 'Though not the quality of Kor Route, The Pew is a worthwhile outting. I found pitch 2 (5.7/8 runout) to be a little sketchy with licheny, flared, runout cracks. After this pitch, the wall steepens and becomes more interesting with minor route finding challenges included.',\n",

       " \"Brent and I began establishing this route ground up in the winter of 1998.  We aided the second pitch and were forced off the wall after 5 pitches, due to a blizzard during the night spent in our portaledge. I later rapped the headwall at the top to scope a line and clean off some loose blocks (I did not place any bolts on rap as stated in the 2003 AAJ, this was placed on lead). Eventually in May of 2002 Brent and I returned to free the entire climb. Parts of the climb are shared with variations of the Dalke Route.   The journey begins to the left of an overhang/cave with a slab above it at the lowest point of the Main buttress of Cathedral Wall.  Here can be found a small tree against the wall which marks the starting point.  Pitch 1. Pull a difficult move behind the small tree to gain access to the slab.  Traverse right and head up to a tree in the middle of the slab (the pitches only real pro). From the tree, head up and slightly left to the base of an overhanging crack system that splits the wall to roof above. Belay in slab just below the crack (5.6R).  Pitch 2. Jump onto the crack system and get ready for a pump. Awesome climbing pulling the lip. Don't mistake this pitch for the overhanging corner system to the right. This pitch goes straight out the middle of the roof to another tree above (5.11).  Pitch 3. Start up the wall to climbers RIGHT of the tree. Meander straight up and gradually slightly left following any protection possibilities you can (5.8R).  Eventually you will end 60m out at a bolt below a white roof.  Pitch 4. Head straight up into the white roof and climb out it's left side and up a crack system to the top of a small pillar right on the prow of the buttress (5.8+).  Pitch 5. Avoid the temtation to head right onto easy terrain. Instead, go directly left 5-10 feet and then straight up (no pro) eventually gaining a ramp system that takes you left. When the ramp levels off and cuts across the entire wall, traverse left under the small roof it forms then surmount it, and climb into the headwall. Follow a non-descript crack into the middle of the wall. At its end, just as things get steep, you're forced to climb out right and up to the big ledge. Fight the rope drag to the back of the ledge and a bolt (5.9).  Pitch 6. Climb onto the upper wall over or around a couple hanging blocks to access a left-leaning ramp, heading towards a large roof above. At the top of the ramp, lieback out the left side of the large roof to gain the main headwall. Above the roof, travel up right then straight up over a flake and up more until a hand traverse ledge takes you right, to a bolt and the belay (5.10+).  Pitch 7. Now that you've gained the best view in RMNP (other than the Diamond), get ready for some fun. Go straight up through a crux section then left to a large flake system that takes you back right to a final, left-leaning, overhanging, hand crack that finishes off the climb (5.10).  Enjoy!\",\n",
       " 'This route is located on the second buttress of Cathedral Wall.  Approach from the Sky Pond trail, traversing across a talus slope to get just to the right of a large right-facing dihedral, located in the middle of the buttress.  The descent is down the back-side and then down Andrews Glacier trail.  Coming back to the base of the route is only an option if you are into punishment.  So, up and over with everything.   The Rossiter guide does list an optional descent as scrambling west up the Cathedral Spires ridge until it is possible to descend talus and a gully to Lake of Glass and the Sky Pond trail.   Pitch 1 - Work your way up to gain an unlikely looking crack that goes to a roof.  Continue angling up to a ledge on the right. (5.9)  Pitch 2 -  Climb up through some grubby trees and follow a right facing corner up to a ledge. (5.6)  Pitch 3 - Climb a ramp that goes up to the left and belay at the bottom of a right-facing dihedral. (5.4)  Pitch 4 - climb the corner and a short, steep crack to a ledge. (5.8)  Pitch 5 - This pitch is basically a scramble.  Go up the ridge through a chimney and belay on a grassy ledge.  (5.4)  Pitch 6 - Climb a right facing dihedral and turn a roof at the top.  Continue to a belay on a ledge beneath a steep wall. (5.8)  Pitch 7 - Climb straight up the crack.  The Rossiter guide says that this pitch is 5.10a, but it is a very short section of hard stuff. The crack gears up well and it is really more of a boulder problem.  Definitely go for this variation.  The other variation hand traverses out to the right from the crack and climbs up the face to a ledge, reportedly, 5.9.  Pitch 8 -  Climb up the right side of a leaning pillar, turn a small roof, and run the rope out to spot to un-rope and rack the gear. (5.6)  Continue to scramble up the gully.  Once you reach the notch, angle down to the left over talus, aiming to find the gully described in the descent for Cathedral Wall. Overall, this route is sort of loose, and not continuous in difficulty.  An ascent of Cathredral Wall is definitely worth the effort, though.  At least this route does not have the letter \"s\" attached anywhere.',\n",
       " 'If you\\'ve started early enough, combined with psyche for more climbing and good weather, this is a fun way to tack on a few more pitches of climbing to the top of \"Tourist Tragedy\" vs. hiking from the top of the buttress.  I\\'ve given this a Grade III, since it\\'s a mini-route on the top of a moderately long, already-established climb. The pitches themselves are each only 100\\' long, and it\\'s possible to walk off (north) via a grassy ledge system at the top of the second pitch if you\\'re not inspired to do the third.   There are a couple cruxes, one on the first pitch and one on the second. Both are well-protected and check in around the 5.8/5.9 level. There\\'s a variety of ways to do the third pitch (including not doing it), but the climbing checks in a little easier (5.7) via the more obvious line.  Overall, the climbing and rock are similar to \"Tourist Tragedy,\" with small, short cruxes with easier climbing in between. There are loose holds and some holds that are better off being avoided altogether. The latter are easy to avoid but still require the climber to pay attention to what he/she is grabbing...like most other routes in the alpine. If it cleaned up, this would be a great way to top out. As it is now, it\\'s good but still scruffy since we\\'re possibly the first climbers on it.   P1 (5.9ish) - Start up a steep (vertical) section of rock that is juggy and rife with \"turf\" hummocks. This is the loosest part of the route with some holds needing to be trundled (since I was guiding today, we didn\\'t trundle very much). After 30\\' or so, there will be an off-width above you; since a #3 was the biggest cam on the rack today, we opted for the thinner, right-hand line. This is a small, left-facing corner/flake that curves back towards the top of the off-width. This starts out easy enough, and protects well with finger-sized cams/nuts but becomes more difficult (crux) as the crack curves back left. Smear your feet and crimp on face holds to the left to easier terrain. Angle up and right another 30\\' or so (exactly 100\\') to a small, semi-hanging belay stance.   P2 (5.8) - Look up and right, you\\'re headed for the small roof capping a left-facing corner system. The climbing is good and protection is thoughtful-but-adequate. There\\'s good pro before the roof moves but not immediately afterwards. To climb past the roof, pull up and right on jugs/crimps and another 10\\' gets you to a nice ledge. Either boulder up a short headwall (iffy pro) or move left up easier climbing to a large terrace.  P3 (5.7) - Amble up and slightly left towards a blocky buttress. The climbing starts out easy enough but steepens near the top. There are a couple tougher moves here but good protection abounds.',\n",

The crux pitch is bilge. Manky rock, with just ok  gear, and steep moves, and short (nice job Brad!)  Above here steep runout 5.8/5.9 climbing up a long  dihedral (with some good bits) eventually dumps you  (dumped me anyway) onto the pretty exciting face on  the right, (at an impasse where an unprotected roof is  guarded by loose choss). Rope drag forced a  semi-hanging belay out here somewhere. Eventually  gain the top of the huge pillar.  Above here the climbing is the definition of mediocre.

       " \"This is a less-visited locale on the eastern side of Rocky Mountain National Park that requires a somewhat longer walk in, but it is a beautiful location with an alpine, granitic cirque with a small number of routes that go up to 1200 feet in length.  Perhaps due to the abundance of closer alpine rock, this mountain can feel fairly remote despite it being a longer day trip.  The climbing is essentially all within a northeastern cirque that has some features that allow it to capture sunshine even into the mid-later afternoon on some aspects.  Rock climbing here has been going on intermittently since at least the 1950s.  Ice and mixed climbing has been going on here since at least the 1960s.  Some fairly well-known climbers have wandered here including Duncan Ferguson, Terry Murphy, Doug Byerly, Greg Sievers, and Dave Johnston.  Interestingly, Lisa Foster notes in her excellent and comprehensive RMNP, The Complete Hiking Guide, 2005, Fairchild was named for a Lucius Fairchild, Wisconsin governor, who never even visited the area.

       " \"This is an older route which ascends a chimney system in its first half and connects with a meandering path of least resistance on the upper face.  The position is excellent, the climbing is not as stellar, but in its entirety, the adventure of this climb makes it a worthy endeavor.  There is an amazing quantity of loose blocks littered all about this face, but a careful climber can avoid most of it.  This was originally done as a 13 pitch climb.  With its wandering nature, rope drag probably will limit how much you can link up this route.  There are probably at least 3 different ways to start this route.  Gillett's guidebook, RMNP, The High Peaks shows at least 2 ways onto the rock.  P1a. This would go basically up from below the chimney off the snow (which looked a bit firm and steep for running shoes).  P1b. This would move in from further up the snow on 5.6 rock per the topo drawn on p. 225 of Gillett's guidebook.   P1c.  Starting from the snowhole off to the left of the Honcho Boncho Buttress, keep your approach shoes on as you traverse on the gravel/rocks onto the rock.  This would be the dotted line on p. 224 of Gillett's guidebook.  There will be plenty of looseness here.  If you do this version, you'll want to make essentially a traverse to a shelf that goes to the base of a small prow of rock.  4th class, 180'.  P2. Move up and right with a 5.7 move to gain another long shelf. Gain the chimney system.  Make a bunch of low 5th class moves with perhaps another 5.7 move tucked in and gain a comfortable perch.  5.7, ~150'.  P3. Here you'll have a choice, go up the chimney in what appears to be squeeze to offwidth size or face climb a bit to the left with a 5.7+ crux (tiny wires).  Arc back right to the chimney.  Find interesting chimney to squeeze chimney climbing.  A backpack in this section may force you to face climb.  Continue up to a good ledge.  5.7, 195'.  P4.  Start on easier terrain.  Carefully pick the blocks you pull on.  About 100' up, you will encounter a more fractured stretch.  At one point here, you can traverse left using a large, thin, hollow flake.  Pull down, not out.  The chimney squeezes down again here, making the second likely sling the pack below him/her.  Gain the top of the chimney on a grassy ledge.  Rope drag will prevent you from going to the far right side of the ledge.  5.7, 140'.  Move the belay ~60' to the right side of the ledge.  P5. This starts with a fairly mossy move on the path of least resistance.  You will zig-zag your way connecting bit and pieces as you generally trend left to gain a perch short of the sunlit notch up and left.  5.6, ~170'.   P6. Follow a left-facing dihedral system to a notch below a pinnacle and a big ledge in the shade.  5.6, 100'.  P7. This is the crystal pitch, 5.7.  Face climb up on white quartz trending left to a large, sloping ledge.  Aliens are useful here. Angle rightward and connect a wandering path to another notch where you can get some sunshine to warm up.  5.7, 170'.  P8.  Go up and slightly right as you link / weave moderate bits together with a bit of rope drag.  There is a tiny crux at the end of this pitch with a few options to pass through it to a good ledge.  5.7, 95'.  P9.  The climbing gets pretty blocky as you try to weave your way to the top of the buttress.  At one point, there is an optional, fun boulder move up a small face off a ledge with 0.75 piece at your feet.  Angle right to the ridge crest.  The top of the ridge seems to be quite hollow, in fact, at one point a rock bumped from one side dropped over the other side just below the belay.  5.7, 190'.  You may find some interesting purple rock along this line.  If anyone figures out what type it is, let me know.  To exit, there is an exposed ridge crest walk ~100' to walking terrain.  With fatigue, wind, stacked blocks, a belay may be in order.  Hike down class 2 slopes to gain the Northeast slopes and The Saddle.

       " \"Probably named for the route's nature and the Portishead song released the same year, this quality route ascends the left side of the west face of Gnome Dome.  The rock quality is reminiscent of Lumpy Ridge and is in a beautiful, isolated setting.  Begin at an obvious ripply seam 50 feet left of the large roof at the bottom center of the dome.  Two fairly long pitches follow discontinuous seams up and a little to the left with sparse/questionable pro every 20'.  Some of the moves are insecure and not well protected.  Lower crux comes at an interesting clean-cut keystone shape at your chest (this looks freshly broken and goes at 5.6, maybe 5.7). These 2 pitches lead up to a ledge beneath the entry to the headwall (Rossiter's topo is very good for this). Crank through the weakness and into the terrific hand crack to the top.  This is a very good pitch.   Due to the nature of the protection, this route isn't recommended for leaders breaking into the grade.\",\n",
       " \"Curiously, this is the only route in Rossiter's guidebook followed by a question mark. I'm not sure if this refers to the name or the rating, but it intrigued me, and since my partner Charles and I were already up there and we had a couple more hours of daylight, we figured we'd get one more route in before heading home.   The first pitch is described as a shallow dihedral, and even from the base of the route you can't see what the crack inside this feature looks like, so it didn't occur to me to bring up anything larger than a #3 Camalot. The first 30-35 feet of the first pitch is sustained 5.9 climbing protected by small to medium stoppers and an occasional micro cam, after which you pull left a few feet into the true shallow dihedral, the bottom of which would have taken a #4 Camalot. Instead of a crack running up the length of the inside of the corner, there's a flared groove that gets progressively more flared, and moss-filled the higher up it goes, lacking any decent protection options. I figured there MUST be some sort of gear placement higher up, so I kept climbing, getting more and more gripped and pumped from the strenuous lieback/pinch (liebacks never were my forte), no gear in sight. After almost 20 feet of this, there looked to be a decent hold about 8 feet higher where I might be able to rest and get a piece in, so I kept moving, hoping I'd make it before losing all my strength. But before I got more than a couple moves higher, my feet popped without warning and I fell, pulling my last piece (the second smallest Alien) 20+ feet below and finally being caught by my next-highest piece (a mid-sized Sentinel Nut), landing upside-down inches from the ground, grass poking through the ventilation holes of my helmet. Moral of the story: if there's a question mark in the guidebook, it means the author probably hasn't climbed it.\",\n",
       " 'Rock Of Ages is a fine granite wall in Rocky Mountain National Park. Unlike the High peaks, this wall has a short approach and is a good cragging wall. The climbs vary between 1-3 pitches in length and are generally from 100 to 200 feet long. If you find yourself in the Estes Park area and it is too late for a long and committing alpine route, consider this wall as an option. Be warned in advance that most of the climbs here are 5.10+ or harder.  The finer grains and lack of inclusions mean that this rock is very high friction in general, and not too hard on the hands. The granite of this wall ranges from scaly in some spots to bullet-hard and perfect in others. For the most part, the rock is clean, but on the lower right the rock is very scaly and difficult to smear or edge upon.  The face predominantly faces south, although the dihedrals on the East and West ends get shade at one time or another for most of the day. You may be able to climb in the shade for a part of the day, but the must-do classic there, Days Of Heaven (10d), sits in the sun all day.  Some other notable climbs include Nameless Demons (10a), Center Dihedral (10d), Celestial Gate (11-) and a few solid 5.12s, such as Rope Gun With Silencer (5.12), that are too hard for me to comment on in much more detail than to say \"good top-ropes.\" The original trad lines were done in the early 1980s, with some additional development occuring only recently, nearly 20 years later.

It is so subjective and with any climb there will always be many factors that will obviously affect the perception of difficulty. At the time I redpointed this route, I knew a couple climbers who came close but only 2 climbers who had onsighted it, and I am assuming each was a true onsight. To onsight the Wasp without ANY prior knowledge of the moves OR the gear placements is an awesome accomplishment. En route, there are some cryptic sections and a couple of moves where you must bear down, but in general the climbing is more cerebral, and there are no \\xc2\\x93stopper\\xc2\\x94 crux moves.

The rim of Glacier Gorge is formed by Half Mountain, Storm Peak and Long's Peak on the east; Keyboard of the Winds, Pagoda Mountain and Chief's Head Peak on the south; and by McHenry's Peak, Powell Peak and Thatchtop Mountain on the west.

       " 'This ultra marathon spans (counter clockwise) the entire rim of Glacier Gorge traversing 8 summits in perhaps 15 miles.  The 7 towers along the Keyboard of the Winds are not climbed.  Begin at the Glacier Gorge Bus Stop.  Take the Glacier Gorge Trail and ascend the Regular Route on Thatchtop.  Traverse the summit and gain the Continental Divide via the Northeast Ridge of Powell Peak. Traverse Powell Peak and descend into McHenrys Notch.  Climb east out of the notch (5.5, 300 feet) and traverse McHenrys Peak (Northwest Ridge/Stone Man Ridge), Chiefs Head Peak (Northwest Ridge/East Ridge), Pagoda Mountain (Northwest Face/East Ridge), Longs Peak (Southwest Ridge/Keyhole Ridge), Storm Peak and finally Half Mountain.  Descend a talus gully on the northwest side of Half Mountain and regain the Glacier Gorge Trail at Mills Lake.  Run the final 2.5 miles back to the GG Bus Stop. This is a very long and demanding circuit with various challenges beyond sheer endurance such as the Northeast Ridge of Powell Peak, McHenrys Notch, the Northwest Face of Pagoda Mountain and the south ridge of The Dark Tower.  The descent of the Keyhole Ridge is not trivial.  Best time to date: 13 hours, R. Rossiter, 11 August 2009. I am just an old guy.

       " \"Arrowhead is the name given to a collection of spires in the Spearhead Cirque attached to McHenry's via its northeast ridge, directly above Black Lake. Up until a few years ago not many routes had been put up here, probably due to the long approach and relatively short climbs (most are 4 to 5 pitches in length). Recently, however, the abundance of clean, aesthetic lines compacted into a relatively small area has drawn droves of first-ascentionists looking for virgin rock in an otherwise mostly climbed-out Park. The rock here is quality granite, and if the entire formation were picked up and moved to a place like Lumpy Ridge there would already be 100 named routes on it.\",\n",
       " \"It's hard to believe that Airhead, which climbs the plumb line dihedral and crack system up the center of Arrowhead's south face, isn't an RMNP mega-classic.  Not only is the line itself the most obvious directissima on the wall, but the climbing is really good and the crux pitch is one of the gems of the Park.    After approaching via any of the methods listed for Arrowhead, begin climbing from the highest of a series of ledges below the obvious, hanging, left-facing dihedral.  This feature is several hundred feet right of the low-point in the McHenry's-Arrowhead ridge and about a hundred feet left of Ithaca.  The first pitch is just left of the clean slab of Ithaca's first pitch.  Above the dihedral system the beautiful splitter crack of the crux pitch is visible.  P1: Wander up the path of least resistance to a belay ledge about 25 feet below the true start of the corner system.  Do not continue up to what appears to be a sloping ledge at the base of the corner itself as the belay there is poor.  Low 5th.  P2: Climb up the corner with good gear and increasingly difficult moves until an opportunity presents itself to swing out of the corner onto the right hand wall and climb the arete for 40 feet.  Wild!  One can either return to the corner higher up, or continue along the arete to a belay stance.  5.10+, 140'.  P3: With a handful of wires, this pitch is easily linked with the previous one.  Continue up the slightly mossy corner all the way to a nice belay ledge (5.10c?), or, after 20 feet, once again swing out right around the arete and follow unprotected, clean face climbing to the same belay ledge (5.10a R).  A short pitch, maybe 50'.  P4: Amazing!  Ascend the now shallow, left-facing corner for 40 feet before reaching a small roof on the left side.  Pull through this and continue up the stunning splitter past a few cruxy sections punctuated by really good rests.  This pitch takes great, small gear (that is pumpy to place), but it is nice to have some hand-size cams for pods and the anchor.  Lots of thin but positive 5.11 climbing up immaculate rock with one brief section of 5.11+.  Belay on a huge ledge, 120'.  P5: Although a bit scary and having less than ideal pro, this pitch is nevertheless great fun.  From the right end of the ledge, ascend a corner to a chockstone and then hand traverse back left over your belayer's head for 15 feet.  Climb a nice, leaning, finger crack and pull up onto a stance at some loose blocks.  Swing around to the right, then trend back left up a series of stacked blocks all the way to the ridge.  5.9 and possibly very dangerous, 80'.  Descend via the walk-off or rappels (one 70m rope plus easy downclimbing).\",\n",

The rock on this wall is like a steeper version of Lumpy. Orange splitters and good featured faces. It wanders up cracks for 5 pitches before forging up the \"lightning Bolt\" crack (5.11) on the last pitch headwall. One of the more memorable pitches in the Park!

Head straight up the fantastic crack and go left when it splits. Head around the giant flake on its left side and up to a small ledge below the killer Lightning Bolt crack. 5.10  It is possible to go right at the base of the flake when the crack forks, it leads to the same belay and looks fantastic. But requires some bold moves to begin. Bernard says it is 5.11a R getting into it.   We stopped at a ledge before the Lightning bolt and did a small but stout 10c pitch in a small, left-facing corner and block to gain the actual stance below the headwall. A 60 meter rope could probobly combine these.  P5. No route finding here. Step up and send the incredible 100ft. lightning bolt crack with bouldery moves off the belay to sustained stoking up above. 5.11 crux. Continue up through the maze of stacked blocks above, scary looking but very solid and mantle onto the ridge. Incredible 5.9.

From Black Lake, follow slabs up and right to the route, which starts as a series of slabs alternating with tree covered benches.

       " \"This is the MEGA-COOL Ridge traverse of the Glacier Gorge cirque.  Starting with Arrowhead and cruising the ridge crest all the way over to Long's. It's a great long day at altitude, with some wonderful and exposed scrambling/climbing. It incorporates a few classic routes, including the North Ridge of McHenry's (5.4?),the West Ridge of Pagoda (5.7), and the Southwest Ridge of Long's (5.6).  There are several ways to run this ridge.  I like to start at Arrowhead, and go counter-clockwise, so Long's is at the end.  Hike to Black Lake, approach Arrowhead by skirting the lake on its east side and cruise grass ramps up to the base.  Head up to summit of Arrowhead via the Summit ramp (4th class), or any other way you like. Head up the wonderful North Ridge of McHenry's, with great rock, and exposure. 5.4ish? at the hardest.  Then down and across Stone Man Pass, and up over Chiefshead. This is the easiest and most dull part of the traverse, and it's still very mellow and scenic. Head down, and across the Chiefshead/Pagoda Col, and start up the sick West Ridge of Pagoda.  This route begins with wild sidewalks in the sky, then large overhangs on the ridge push you out North. Way exposed face climbing! 5.7ish. Skirt around on the North Face, until you can gain the crest again and then the summit.  Soak in this killer summit, and push on towards Long's. Pass behind the Keyboard of the Winds, surmounting one or two scrubby walls en route.  And make a beeline for the Southwest Corner. This route lies directly above the Narrows section of the Keyhole route. Climb nice cracks and flakes right to the summit (5.6).

Warhead somehow got lost over the years, misplaced in several guidebooks and eventually rediscovered as a \"new\" route (see Bernard Gillett\\'s comments on Watership Down).  The original FA route description is given below.  P1)  Starting from a huge flake lying on a ledge at the slabby base, climb an easy slab pitch to a good grassy stance.  P2)  Climb shallow grooves on the steepening slabs above until they end (5.9).  Move right to a lieback flake, and climb right and up from it into the wet leaning corner formed by the first of the huge arches blocking the lower face.  Follow the corner/arch up and left until a belay ledge appears on the right.  P3)  Step left and climb through the arch at a vertical black flake.  Follow the slabs below the second arch up and left.  P4)  Continue on these slabs for another ropelength, belaying below a rotten area.  P5)  Ascend the left side of this rotten area and the much cleaner chimney and jam crack (now in a large, right-facing corner) above to a grassy ledge.  P6)  Follow the continuing corner for a ways, then move out onto the crystal-studded face to its right.  Belay at about the level of some huge, projectile-like pinnacles that appear out to the left.7)  Go up to a small inset dihedral with an overhang at its top, then continue up steep rock to the summit plateau.  The name \"Warhead\" refers to the large missile-like pinnacles to the left of the 6th belay.  The newer \"Lost Arrow\" route is named for this same feature. ',\n",
       " \"A surprisingly easy route up what appears to be the steepest part of the cliff.  The rock is immaculate.  Approach: Start about 200ft up the easy slabs at the base of Arrowhead's South Face (4th class) on the right end of a long terrace.  This point is about 100ft left of the right margin of the apron, between the routes Medusa and Refugium.  1. 190ft 5.8s Climb a shallow, left-facing diheral rightwards up the slab, follow a shallow, right-leaning ramp, then zig-zag up the obvious shallow corners.  Pull over an overlap to reach a sloping ledge, beneath the obvious weakness in the roofs above.  2. 200ft 5.9 A flared chimney leads to a steep, left-facing dihedral which breaches the overhang (crux). Above the steepness, follow a huge left trending ramp with finger cracks and excellent exposure until you run out of rope. There is a ledge here with a fixed hex.  3. 190ft 5.9 Continue up the steepening ramp until a broken area is reached. Belay above this at the base of a steep chimney on the left.  4. 150ft 5.8 Climb the chimney, pass the huge chockstone and enter a stellar, right-facing corner with hands. Follow this to an obvious ledge on the left.  5. 150ft 5.8 Climb the chimney and then up into a shallow, right-facing corner (hands and fists).  Where this ends, follow an exposed flake system leftwards to the top.  The descent is either by summiting Arrowhead and dropping down into the 4th class descent terrace system, or faster, by hiking west to the low point of the ridge and rapping.  This route, or a similar line, has been climbed previously by an unknown party, who left the fixed hex described on pitch 2.  Anybody out there have any info?\",\n",
       " \"Chiefshead is located at the head of Glacier Gorge, and stands between Pagoda Mountain to the east and McHenry's Peak to the northwest.  The north ridge or central rib of Chiefshead extends northward to become the striking Spearhead formation (12,575).  The northwest face and the northeast face contain most of the technical routes, but there are other moderate alpine and snow/ice/mixed routes to be found on the mountain.\",\n",
       " 'The route begins on the NW side of the Chiefshead, below the NW face.  The north ridge or central rib is obvious from this location to your left.  Follow steep disconnected ramps and ledges up to the NE to gain the rib proper.  Once on the rib, a rope might be nice for about a pitch or less depending on how comfortable you are with exposure (5.easy).  After 100-200 feet, the route turns back into scrambling for a bit, until you are directly under the north ridge proper.  From here, you have several choices, and route finding becomes more interesting.  Stay directly on the arete proper for the 5.7 route.  The rock is fairly good, and the exposure and views become increasingly robust.  Venture to the left or the right of the route for easier/harder terrain. About 3/4 of the way up the route, before the final headwall, there is an option to traverse west above the NW face to avoid all of the difficulties.  Descent: Follow the northwest ridge down to Stone Man pass.',\n",
       " 'This route ascends the prominent spur or arete on the south side of Chief\\'s Head Peak, almost opposite the Central Rib on the north side.  It could have a more inspiring name than \"South Spur,\" but nothing has come to mind. The line is fairly obvious from the southwest.  I first noticed it a few years ago from the North Ridge of Isolation Peak.  Hike the Wild Basin Trail to a junction at 4.8 miles, go right to Lion Lake #1 and onward to Snowbank Lake, about 7.5 miles from the trailhead.  Continue northwest past the lake, then scramble up moraine to the bottom of the spur.  The first 200 feet are quite vertical, so go up and right, and cut back left on a ledge that leads to a cave under a little waterfall.  Just left of the cave, climb a short, vertical wall to a higher ledge (5.7). Work up and left to the ridge crest.  Climb the crest or right-facing dihedrals on the right for 1000 feet.  Obvious cracks lead up a final buttress (5.7) to hiking terrain, about 300 feet southeast of the summit.  This is a good ridge line that holds with other park standards, such as the South Ridge of Pagoda, North Ridge of Spearhead, Blitzen Ridge on Ypsilon, Keyhole Ridge on Long\\'s, Ripsaw on Arrowhead, et cetera.  That there is no record of prior ascent follows considering the route\\'s deep obscurity and long approach.',\n",
       " 'The NE face of Chiefshead is the massive wall above Green Lake in Upper Glacier Gorge (to the left when facing Spearhead).  It should not to be confused with the more popular Northwest Face of Chiefshead which lies above Frozen Lake in the cirque to the right of Spearhead (on the Stoneman Pass side).  Ignored for years- I suspect because from a distance it looks a bit broken and not that big, and is a hump to get to- the number of routes on this impressive wall tripled in the 90s due to the efforts of Greg Davis and Eric Winkelman.  There are now 8 recorded routes on the wall, ranging in difficulty from 5.8 to mid-5.11, with at least 2 more independent undone lines waiting for a bold leader.  The routes can be characterized by excellent face climbing (runout at times), somewhat wandering and vague lines which require excellent routefinding skills, and a sense of commitment which increases as the climber becomes aware of how big this wall really is.  The 90s routes have bolts where necessary, but are not clip-ups, and a full rack of gear, including RPs and TCUs, is required.  The wall may seep in spots, and facing NNE receives limited sun.  The best descent is to scramble up and left to the summit ridge, then hike due east (Lion Lakes and Wild Basin to your right) to the notch between Chiefshead and Pagoda, then descend (with some scrambling and snow) the East Couloir back to the base.  Plan on at least 45 minutes.  The shorter, alternative descent is to downclimb the snow gully which forms the right edge of the wall and leads to exposed, loose, 4th and easy 5th class ledges.  I did this once and do not recommend that you follow in my foolish footsteps.  Rappelling the routes is not a good option since the wall is so big, and there are very few fixed anchor stations.  Still, 2 ropes are a good idea if you need to bail, but plan on leaving your own gear for anchors.  The nature of this wall makes it feel somewhat committing.  Chances are you will have the place to yourself.  This is what RMNP climbing probably felt like in the 60s. ',\n",
       " 'Cowboys and Indians is the most popular, and perhaps finest, route on the NE Face of Chiefshead.  At 11 or so pitches, it is one of the longest routes in RMNP.    On the right side of the wall, and just left of obvious terraces, find a thin finger crack (5.10d) leading to 3 bolts which protect 5.10 climbing.  Belay on a ledge below an imposing, left trending roof.  Undercling the roof left (strenuous) to a stance out left (optional belay) and continue up an easier left facing corner.  If you skip the optional belay take care you don\\'t stick your rope in the left edge of the roof (probably better to belay at the intermediate stance - then you get to watch your second undercling the roof).  Climb a short left facing 5.9 corner leading to easier (5.8) climbing and a ledge (short pitch). (Ten Little Indians crosses the route here.)  If you belayed at the optional belay below, it may be possible to combine this pitch with the following 5.10a pitch.  Head up slightly left, then straight up past an overlap and 3 bolts, 5.10a or so, to a ledge with a 2 bolt anchor.  Now climb the pretty wall above (3 bolts, soft for 5.11a) to a right facing corner, 5.8, and belay above.  Now climb a (second) bolted section (rated 5.11c on one topo I have seen, but no way) which leads to a ledge- a long 165+ foot pitch, optional belay out left and lower at a fixed wire.  Move up and left across a corner roof (5.10a) to a 5.8 crack and belay ledge above.  A 5.9 crack groove leads to the large ledge and cave area which is the most prominent feature on the upper wall.  It is on these two previous pitches that routefinding gets fuzzy, and you may find yourself climbing something that bears no resemblance to my description.  Walk right 140 feet to below a steep corner with a couple of fixed pins and belay.  Climb the corner (a 5.11c boulder problem), with the fixed pins a bit lower than you would like and continue to a nice, if cramped, belay ledge.    Now either head right under a roof, then up a right facing corner (5.9), or go up and left from the belay on spicy 5.9 face, belay, then climb the \"hanging gardens\" 5.4 pitch to the top.',\n",
       " 'I am pretty sure this is a new route, but I stand to be corrected.  The route begins with some scrambling up towards the base of many dihedrals on the left side of the wall. Look for a good ledge just left of a prominent, hanging arete.    P1. Climb up a right-facing corner with a killer undercling, tiny locks, and long reach to an obvious, blocky band (some rotten). Mantel the band, and face climb into a large dihedral (5.12- R or 5.10 C2). Continue up the killer corner with great fingers, a hand crack on the left can be used at times. Belay at a good stance above the dihedral (5.11-).  The short corner/seam guarding this pitch was freed on-sight by the first ascent party, but due to the nature of the rest of the climb, we thought that a clean aid rating would not deter the 5.10 climber. The addition of a pin has been discussed and would remove some spice.  P2. Continue up a fading, thin hand crack, pull a couple face moves, and re-engage a sweet splitter over a small roof onto easier terrain. Stretch the rope generally up and left. This is good, clean climbing (5.10).  P3ish. Simul climb up then right around 200 feet of lower angle terrain. A wider dihedral above looks great, but we meandered further right to belay on a large, sloping ramp at another steep dihedral. This open book is obvious from the ground.  P4. Climb fingers in the corner. It is easier than it looks. Belay at the top (5.9+).  P5-7. Simul to the top. Head left at first up a wide blob, then go up. We meandered slightly right aiming towards an obvious finger/hand crack slicing the slabs. That adds a little extra climbing and jamming (5.7)!',\n",
       " \"Ten Little Indians is great long outing on a remote wall. At 11 pitches long, it is more committing than the Diamond considering you would lose most of your rack if you bailed high on the route.  Most of the climbing is in the 5.8 to easy 5.10 range, with only a few moderate runouts. The rock is not the same quality as Birds of Fire, but there are some great sections of climbing between your standard alpine crack and face climbing.  P1: (5.9-, 130 feet) From the left side of the rock tongue angle left through thin cracks to the base of the wide crack (8-12 inches).  Climb this to a good ledge.  P2: (5.10R or 5.9-, 110 feet) The original P2 heads up the rightmost thin, RF dihedral. The pin is missing, so the first good gear is 20-25 feet up. A more sane option angles left to the ledge above.  P3: (5.10a, 100 feet) From the ledge shared with Cowboys and Indians, traverse straight left past a bolt and belay at the base of a RF dihedral. You can link P2/3 with a 70m if you avoid the original RF dihedral.  P4: (5.8+, 110 feet) Head up the obvious, RF corner and traverse left 50ft on a ledge to a right-facing flake system.  P5: (5.9R, 140 feet) This is probably the best on the route. Head up a cool system of flakes for about 90 feet and look for a passage to the left. There is a final crack system that leads to a two bolt anchor. The path we took to avoid a water streak did have a 20 foot runout on 5.9.  P6: (5.10b PG13, 150 feet) Head straight left past two bolts on thin and thought provoking face climbing. At the end of the traverse head straight up combining thin crack features. Belay on a ledge system up and left.  P7: (5.8R, 210 feet) Climb the RF dihedral and angle hard left to the exit crux pitch on Long ledge. There is some positive 5.5 climbing with 30-40 foot runouts.  P8: (5.11a, 50 feet) Climb the shallow, RF corner past an old pin. Traverse a horizontal crack system to the left and make crux moves up at the next pin, which can be backed up with good gear. The crux consists of huge moves between positive holds.  P9: (5.9, 120 feet) Traverse straight right on an angling crack system. As you near the end of a semi-detached flake, crank up to a belay stance.  P10: (5.9, 180 feet) There is a short, 5.9, RF dihedral to a long section of 5.6 alpine rock.  P11: (5.?, 180 feet) Find the easiest path to the top.  The best descent takes the ridge line to a gully on climber's left.\",\n",
       " \"It's not the NORTH SIDE OF CHIEFSHEAD. It's the South Face of Chiefshead. I'd like to call it Thurmond's Wall, if there are no objections. The Southface has a cool wall that I fell in love with while staring at it from the east face of Mt. Alice. It has a little gendarme just left of center 50'?  The first route I did is on the lower right side of the wall. A small roof of the ground leading into a right-facing dihedral. The crack system is pretty much straight up for 2 pitches. There is a nice belay under a spectacular roof, vibrant with most of the colors in a rainbow. These cracks are a sprt (sic) climbers dream if they are looking for splitter 5.14 and up roof cracks. Plus, there is this big sloping ledge under the roof that makes bailing a snap. I aided several of the sickest free cracks I have ever seen, just because leap-frogging Friends through those colors was irresistable. But the free route goes straight over the belay. DANGER!!! Large stone!! is loose above the belay. As you step out over the belay to get through the roof, you want to stand on it. DON'T! It's easy to avoid. Just be careful PLEASE. Who knows? Maybe it fell? The last pitch is kind of a spire. Easy climbing up its south face leads to a pointed to out (sic). Walk down east through the scree slopes.  I give it 3 stars, because it is so remote. It's south-facing. The views are out-of-hand gorgeous, and you can spend the whole day naked, because nobody ever goes there. Plus, the big horn herd hangs out here. You can bivy at Mt. Alice, but not here. Check with the Rangers about the rules to this area.  It's a little piece of Eldo in the park. Jim Thurmond.\",\n",
       " 'The NW Face of Chiefshead retains an aura of mystery and commitment to this day, even though it is now possible to rap down the center of the face.  Still, an ascent of any route on the wall is a worthy achievement since \"fuzzy\" runout climbing is the norm.  The combination of a significant approach, remote setting, northeast aspect, and challenging climbing provides a perfect diversion from the same old ho-hum climbing on neighboring Spearhead.  Rich in history, the wall was first climbed in 1961 by Layton Kor and Bob Culp - quite an impressive achievement for the time.  A classic account of their ascent can be found in the Godfrey and Chelton book \"CLIMB!\", now out of print.  Free climbed with minor variations almost fifteen years later by Billy Westbay and Dan McClure (and dubbed \"The Path of the Elders\", 5.10a R), this route is certainly the most accessible of the trad routes on the wall.  The second route to be established on the wall, 7 Arrows (5.10b R, FA Charlie Fowler and John Harlin Jr., 1980), was a statement of commitment to the principals of ground-up adventure climbing, offering wandering yet difficult climbing, marginal protection (no bolts), and poor prospects for retreat.  The quality of this climb is generally highly regarded, and it may be considered one of the Park\\'s true gems - although one prolific local has descibed it as a \"trough\".  Fowler returned in 1987 with Dan McGee to up the ante into the realm of insanity with their \"Screaming Eagles\" (5.10 X), a route characterized by 100 foot runouts, nonexistent belay anchors, and insecure face climbing.    In 1988 Richard Rossiter, with Joyce Rossiter and Rob Woolf, introduced a new approach in style, when, after many days of both onsight and rap-bolted progress, they established the directissima on the wall, \"Birds of Fire\" (5.11a R). This hybrid sport-trad route climbed the cleanest, blankest section of rock on the wall (one the finest sweep of granite in RMNP).  Awash in controversy after it was first climbed (some locals came very close to chopping the roughly 30 bolts used), Birds of Fire is now regarded as a Park classic, and during high season weekends may have several parties on it.  Perhaps 95% of the people who climb on this wall do Birds of Fire, so if this is your plan get there early.  Even so, prepare for close encounters since the climbing route is also the rap route.  And don\\'t expect bolts everywhere you need them- it is still a somewhat runout route.  Even at prime season (late July and early August) it can be a cold, wet place, so try to catch it on a hot day in the lowlands.  Early season be prepared for wet rock, and often the upper sections of the routes will be unclimbable at that time due to seeping.  Expect some hassles crossing the snow to get to the base, and often a sizeable moat protecting the rock.  There is a small, awkward staging area on the flakey ledge system at the base of 7 Arrows, but racking up in the meadow before the snow crossing may be easier.  Two ropes are required for the rappels, otherwise you need to walk and scramble off to the right from the (at times snowy) prominent ledge where the technical routes end.  Consider bivying in Upper Glacier Gorge for a couple of days, and climbing on Spearhead or the NE Face of Chiefshead after your NW Face tick.  Or sample some of the bouldering potential this high glacial valley provides.  Most of the routes will take a good part of the day to complete.  Bring lots of tech rock gear, and watch food in your pack if you leave it at the base- the ravens up there know how to open a fastex buckle.  ',\n",
       " '7 Arrows is a very worthwhile climb that provides much adventure and excitement, along with superb granite face climbing. The line is fairly obvious, starting on prominent flakes just left of center (and left of the bolts on Birds of Fire), and taking on the singular natural weakness through the first 100 feet of the lower wall.  The route then follows corners and brief blank sections for several pitches, heading for a black water streak which originates on the large ledge at the top of the face.  The route is well described in both Rossiter and Gillett, although quite frankly you need to allow your instincts to guide you through many sections, and a sense of \"being off-route\" should not disturb you (hence my lack of a proper pitch-by-pitch description here).  There is gear to be found, but a little creativity is required to sniff out the placements.  Expect to climb mandatory 5.8 and 5.9 passages with minimal (or no) gear.  Obviously not a place to be in a rainstorm.  Belay anchors are OK, but not great.  Lower on the route you can escape right to anchors on Birds of Fire, but by midway be prepared to have to punch for the top.  Depending on where you actually climb high on the route, expect a trace more 5.10-, and lots of sustained, \"bumpin-ugly\" face climbing at a slightly easier grade.  ',\n",
       " 'I was one of the indignant climbers (see Steve Levin\\'s  comments in the introduction) who hoped to remove the bolts on this route (a very early fall snowstorm stopped Mark \"Prybar\" Wilford and me from the dirty deed itself), I finally climbed this a couple years later, sans prybar, and found it to be not only nothing like the sport route I was expecting but also one of the best routes I have ever done in the Park, (or anywhere else for that matter).  The rock is nothing short of perfect for most of the route.  Try to catch this as soon as it dries out, hopefully in early July, as the sun will be on the face for much of the day. A few short weeks later, the sun exposure is considerably less.  A reconnaissance visit to Spearhead in June will tell you if the face is in condition or not.  After two ascents of this climb, I can state with confidence that the crux is actually gaining the cliff, but then I have always had a thing about snow....  P1. This is not so great actually, but good, and at least it gets you away from that wet sloppy white stuff. Save a hand-size cam or two for the belay.  P2. After some initial thin moves right by the belay, there is a thin runout slab with inobvious moves, before a long and unprotected traverse left (5.7X) on a big ledge system. This pitch introduces you to the delights in store above.  P3. The meat! After some thin moves at moderate 5.10 past a couple bolts, traverse left, very thin, to a bolt, from where committing 5.10 moves lead up, up and up into  apparent blankness. The ropework on this pitch alone dictates use of double ropes. This pitch also ends up wildy runout toward the top, with many opportunities for getting irreversibly stuck offroute.  P4. (5.10) More of the same. By now you should be used to the nature of the climbing. There are just enough bolts to tip the balance in favor of continuing upwards, but vegan-fed, neurotic, Sport Park regulars will need to bring a change of underwear.  P5. If pitch three is the meat course, this is the dessert, a Creme Brulee delight of face knobs and bullet edges up the White Streak. This maintains a heavenly 5.9 standard for the whole ropelength up this perfect boilerplate face. This pitch is comparatively well-protected, but divide six bolts into 150 feet and you get, um, well you still get a pitch not to be trifled with. By the time you reach the lonely belay foothold at the end of this pitch, it should be more or less raining, so you may be feeling that you can retreat without shame from the end of the fifth pitch. Above here, there are two more good sections, but a lot of filler, so you may be right.  P6. After yet another runout on thin face (surprise!) past a couple more bolts, you gain merely good 5.7 climbing in a dihedral.  P7. This is a short, nondescript pitch.  P8. This is the after-dinner port. If the rain has not set in yet, this pitch is actually real good, with tenuous 5.10  laybacking up a sharp arete. Plus the bolts seem closer together here than usual.  Unfortunately this section runs out all too soon, and unless you want to lower off a single bolt at this point (the fifth bolt on this pitch), you have to wallow up another one and a-half pitches of mank (at least compared to the rest of the route) to gain another set of rap bolts at the top of the cliff.  This is worth it for first-timers. Ahhh, roll on next summer. . . .',\n",
       " 'This was climbed by 3 folks who had all climbed or met in New Zealand, and wanting to keep with the avian theme of the wall, we chose a tongue-in-cheek name to represent the route. It\\'s probably Grade III to the top of the wall and Grade IV to the top of the mountain. - Graham Zimmerman made a neat movie-  The movie and more photos here.   Follow the major, right-facing corner system, which is roughly 500\\' left of Birds of Fire. After 6 pitches, this route reaches the major, arching ledge that cuts above the face. From here, it is possible to walk right to the rappels of Birds of Fire, or the walkoff, farther climber\\'s right.  However, the route continues with 5 more pitches to the summit. These 5 pitches could be reached from any route on the wall. Rock in the vicinity of the final 2 pitches had been climbed prior to our ascent.  Both of the first two pitches are probably frequently wet. Luckily it\\'s possible to protect the crack and climb the dry face.  P1 - Begin in the moat, immediately right of two very small, left-facing corners. Face climb up the arete to the right of the rightmost of these small corners. After 20\\', move well left passing all crack systems, and face climb up and back right into the 4\" crack. Finish in an alcove with a RFC and roof. 5.8, 70\\'.  P2  - The crux is somewhat tricky to protect - the best beta seems to be climb 15\\' up the from the belay to gear under the roof, then downclimb back and face climb straight right to a positive flake. With cam in place, this face climb is well-protected for the leader and is around 5.10d. Climb straight up from the flake and crack, laybacking on a right-facing flake, and using face holds on the left. ~25 feet above the height of the roof, step left and enjoy rad face climbing just left of the major crack (which is probably wet). 5.10d.  P3 - Climb the right edge of the flake system with a little delicate undercling rightward to a belay at the end. 5.9, 100\\'.  P4 - Go up the corner which, in our dreams, would go on for a few hundred meters. Step left up blocky ground at the top. 5.8, 100\\'.  (P3/P4 Variation - climb the flake and crack above the belay atop P2, through a chimney. Face climbing, and a larger, more prominent chimney, brings one to the same ledge atop p4. 5.10a)  P5 - Move left on the ledge system for ~20. A clean, 0.75\", left-facing crack/corner is above and right. Climb this for 25\\' to its top and place gear. Traverse straight left (5.8 runout) on beautiful nubbins and into the right edge of a flake system. Climb this flake system to its apex, left of a small white roof/overlap visible from the belay. Face climb upward left-to-right above this small overlap, and follow the right edge of a second flake system. From atop this 2nd flake system, climb more golden nubbins (5.8 runout) to a horizontal break. Hanging belay here.  P6 - A faint flake/feature curves up and left from the belay. Find the surprise #4 Camalot pod out right shortly after embarking, and then continue left up the slab to a left-trending flake and ramp system, which gets easier as you go. This flake and ramp finishes with a short 5.8 bulge and brings one to the big ledge that curves across the wall.   P7 - Walk left to the end of the ledge/terrace. Climb up and left into a finger, hand, and twin hand crack on a blunt arete/prow, shortly left of a OBVIOUS corner. At the big ledge, move right to the base of the CLEAN, upper dihedral 5.10a, 55 meters.  P8 - Go up the thin-hands corner, 5.8.  From here, you are on the North Ridge of Chiefshead, which connects to Spearhead. This has been climbed by Bill Wright and Buzz Burrell in 2009, likely others well before. Unrope and walk up the talus for a couple hundred feet until the ridge steepens. Multiple options are presented. Our route:  P9 Somewhat on the right side of the buttress and just left of a very thin and vegetated corner, find a hand crack on a steep face, diagonaling up from right to left. Keep climbing up a little more and belay at the base of a long, low-angle hand crack and left-facing corner. 5.10b  P10 and P11 - Two more nearly 200\\' pitches of quite nice crack climbing lead to the summit. Just aiming for the steepest and cleanest line in this section is probably the best option.',\n",

P2: Follow a left-facing flake through the \"head\" and continue up to a series of ledges (5.7, 150 feet)..[or follow huge broken flakes that provided small left-facing dihedrals on their left side, then finish over some easy ledges and belay at the base of a left-leaning ramp].

Dog Cheese turned out to be a surprisingly nice route given the vague route descriptions in the guidebooks available at the time, and it was great to find a new line.  The route starts near Dog Star, and a black stained corner was attempted, but the pro seemed uncertain, so an exit around that to the left was used to access the upper part of the wall. Various grassy ledges and slabs lead to the  steeper upper wall.  An angling crack that came in around low to mid-5.10 was encountered in the middle portion of the route with a bit of an overlap. Cracks and corners led up to the final obstacle at a ledge high on the wall. A final steep finger crack seemed the most protectable option and was probably the crux of the route overall.  After Scott and I topped out, we enjoyed watching Tom and Rich climb the final pitch from the ridge. Tom asked if the crack was 5.8, perhaps hoping for a quick finish? I noted that it was more like 10+, but I had at least cleaned out the key gear placements already. An epic hike out took us most or all of the night.  It is obvious that the Fixed Pin errors were intentional considering that they had the other three members of the FA team listed and most of the route details correct.

There are several ways to get to the saddle between McHenry\\'s and Arrowhead.  A non-technical route starts from Lake Solitude, and reaches the saddle from the north.  A 5.6 route, called \"The Shaft\", was climbed in 1957 to reach the saddle from the south.  This area contains several rap anchors and appears from above to be harder than 5.6, so bring a more serious rack if you go for this option (also consult the guidebooks).  A third alternative is to climb the South Ramp route on Arrowhead (called \"Summit Ramp\" in Gillett\\'s guide) and continue along the ridge.  This involves less bushwhacking than the first option but you may not need to carry a rope if you are comfortable free soloing 4th class terrain.  From the saddle, climb up the NE Ridge, or the face to its right.  The sharp NE Ridge crest can be climbed all the way but you will probably want a rope for that, and there are two gendarmes that you may have to rappel off of (one is climbed by \"Kidnapper Van\").  At the start, you can climb the NE ridge, but then the easiest line diverges to the right of the ridge.  Near the top, the easiest option is to move right into a shallow gully, but you can also climb the face to the left of this, or go back to the NE Ridge itself.

The 5.5-5.6 crux is near the top of the fourth pitch, just before topping out on the initial buttress.  At the crux are three crack systems, two to the east and one to the west of the ridge.

He awards extra points for the alpine experience. I\\'m thinking maybe 1.5 stars. The second pitch of Age Axe is very good but a little dangerous. P1, 3, 4, and 5 are pretty easy but pleasant. P6 is hard, but a little grungy with a death block. So, I\\'m thinking 1.5 stars.  Rossiter calls P2 10b/c and P6, the last pitch, 10c. Gillett calls these pitches 10a. So I\\'ll split the difference and call P2 and P6 10b.  Approach: Hike to the left side of the NE face. As you round the prow to the SE face, there is a nice \"apron\" slab with right-facing flakes on its right side. 100\\' above is a large, low-angle, right-leaning, right-facing corner capped by a roof. This is about 100\\' right of the start of East Prow.  P1 5.7: Angle right onto the apron to a thin RP crack. A few tiny nuts protect some 7ish moves. Easier climbing leads up and left onto a low-angle slab. Angle left and belay at the base of the large, right-facing dihedral.  P1: 5.10b s?: Place gear high in the dihedral, step down a bit, and traverse left around the ar\\xc3\\xaate to a low angle slab. Climb up to a fixed pin at the base of a crack. Back this pin up, and try to get gear at least several feet higher (may want to aid on the pin to place the higher gear). The problem is is that if you fall on the crux moves above you will hit the slab unless you get gear high in the crack. Reach left for good holds and mantle (crux). Clip an original 1/4\" bolt (Screamer) and do a few more hard moves to get established on the lower angle slab above. Good gear here. Angle slightly right staying just left of the ar\\xc3\\xaate with no gear (maybe an RP at an overlap) but on big knobs for maybe 30\\'. Gillett implies that you are following the crack, but in reality, the crack is around the ar\\xc3\\xaate to the right on a very steep face. This climbing is exposed and fun, but be careful. At a left-angling, almost horizontal flake/thin crack, finger traverse left to a ledge.  P3: 5.8: Step right and climb an easy fun shallow right facing corner. Harder moves lead up opposing corners. Continue up the right hand crack system until it is possible to move left to a small ledge with an old 1/4\" bolt. This bolt is unnecessary since there are good nuts in a crack just to the right, and the climbing is easy. Perhaps the FA party belayed here. Move left from the bolt and up and left on flakes to a ledge. Climb a shallow, left-facing corner (or a looser corner further left) to a good ledge with a block that can be slung. This is the \"horn\" mentioned in Gillett. East Prow joins here.  P4 5.8: Climb an open book with a hand/fist crack. There are only a few mandatory fist moves, since most of the way there are good knobs and other holds. Be careful of loose rock, since you are directly above your belayer. Clip two old bolts for a directional and walk to the right end of the ledge.  P5 5.7: Climb up and right along an easy ramp to the base of some big left facing flakes. Climb these or, as we did, traverse further right and then up some thin flakes. At the grassy ledge, move far left. If you climbed via the right hand variation, you will notice what appears to be a chipped hold that makes the walk left on the grassy ledge reasonable. Before seeing this hold I was considering crawling the ledge.  P6 10b: The difficulties begin right off the ledge. Climb the sustained crack for about 20\\' to a stance on some grass bogs. This involves a few handjams, fingerjams and laybacks. Gillett mentions 3 fixed nuts, but they are not longer there. The crux for me was hanging in, getting the gear. This crack is a little grungy and very different in character from the climbing to this point. A little higher is a large block wedged in the corner that thumps and looks very dangerous. Gingerly climb over this, and don\\'t put gear in it. Higher up, step left at a bulge around the corner onto a welcome rest ledge on the face. Step back right and climb a short crack to the huge loose ledge. You can get gear for the belay about 20\\' back from the edge at some hand-sized cracks. I linked P5 and P6 using double ropes, running one rope directly up the corner above the belayer to the crux crack.  Descent: As described under East Prow, it is possible to walk towards Chiefshead and then back down along a ramp that is not visible from above. We chose the safer alternative of continuing further along the grassy ledge until it was possible to zig zag easily down to the talus. This descent is clearly visible from above and totally safe, with no fall potential, with a couple of short 3rd class sections.',\n",

Choose whatever approach pitch you like to get to Middle Earth Ledge and begin just below the left side of the Eye of Mordor.  1: Climb up into a left-facing flake system, undercling left, continue up flakes up and right to a belay ledge just below a 5' long splitter finger crack.  5.9  2: Climb up and right (a good 20' or so right) to another ledge system just below a left-leaning, slightly offset RP seam.  This seam is invisible from the previous belay.  Note that the guidebook indicates the presence of a pin which is nonexistant.  Protect the starting moves with good RP's, then run it out a few feet to more good placements (5.10d with ledgefall potential).  Head right on easy ground to a nice ledge and belay at two pins.  3: Climb up and undercling right along the obvious flake, then face climb above to reach another flake system which is followed to a belay stance at right.  5.9 s  4: Continue up the right-facing shallow flake system that becomes a flaring slot of sorts with tricky/limited pro for the first 50' or so.  Trend left past two pins in flakes to the obvious circular feature.  Belay here (hand size cams) or link with the next pitch (judicious use of runners and pro).  5: Probably the best pitch on the route.  Pull out of the circular belay on bomber 5.10- fingerlocks and faceholds.  Follow the finger crack up until you can step into a left-facing corner.  Follow this to a two-bolt belay out right below the crux pitch.  6: 3 bolts protect the balancey, Not So Obvious moves off the belay; some tricky micro-routefinding leads to a tough pull up into a shallow left-facing corner.  Head up this corner and step right into a second corner system - this one protected by another three bolts to another bolted belay.  This pitch is a safe lead but would be difficult to French Free.  5.11d, maybe 12a.  7: 4 bolts protect some nice 5.11- face/slab climbing that leads to broken corners/cracks and the summit ledge.

We were using a 60m rope, so my belays were based accordingly.  P1. Start up the most prominent, right-facing dihedral slightly left of the actual prow and about 100\\' left of Age Axe. It\\'s a clean, wide crack, easy 5.6; I belayed on top of the \"tooth-shaped\" flake just left and slightly below the \"7\" on Rossiter\\'s topo. Close to a full rope length.  P2. Continue up on slightly harder climbing to the ominous roofs above and find the easiest way through (5.8). Look for a left-facing dihedral just over the roof and continue up a ways. Rossiter shows a belay just over the roof. I belayed about 40-50 feet higher just below another small roof. About 150\\'.  P3. Here I think I may have been off route. From the small roof, there are 2 options; straight up and over the roof in the continuation of the dihedral which turns into a small hand/fingers crack over the roof (which \"MAY\" be the 5.7 way that Rossiter shows) or continue up left around the roof which turns into a very shallow left-facing dihedral that I thought was more like 5.9-. In any case, both variations merge on easy ground at the junction of the true \"South Arete\". Belay just below a 3\" crack in a beautiful orange open book. You are now on \"Age Axe\".  P4. Jam and stem up the open book with excellent position, (sustained 5.8), 80-100\\' to a wide ledge and belay. Rossiter incorrectly shows double bolts at the right end of this ledge. They\\'re actually at the left end. Shift the belay over to the right just below some large flakes/chimney.  P5. Climb up through the large flakes to another large ledge. A short 5.4 pitch.  P6. The business: you have 2 choices here. The crack straight above is the final pitch of Age Axe (5.10c and fairly well fixed with wireds). My partner wasn\\'t up for that so we shifted the belay a ways right and finished up the final pitch of 3 Stoners (5.9). (The mental crux of the route was climbing across the down sloping, sidewalk wide ledge that is the common last belay for Age Axe, Stone Monkey and 3 Stoners.) The final pitch up 3 Stoners is excellent. A short 5.9 chimney leads up 20\\' to a point you can step right and into a perfect 5.9 finger crack. The rock here is really good! Continue up this to a final roof passed on the left and up to the descent ledge.  Descent: as mentioned by others, walk down SW (leftwards-facing uphill) a long ways on a fairly open ledge/meadow. There are a few cairns. At some point, you need to downclimb a bit to gain the top of a long, NE facing (left; facing downhill) ramp. It\\'s VERY easy to get cliffed-out here! Take some care to find the proper place to turn down. I don\\'t remember there being any cairns to mark the point but there is a faint trail. The long ramp back down is a lot like the descent down Redguard and wouldn\\'t be lot of fun in wet or icy conditions.',\n",
       " 'A good beginner alpine route. [The] first half is forgettable, but the last two pitches are perfect for their grade.  Stay to the left of the ridge to find the last two pitches.  Expect 8-10 pitches depending on your rope, your belay spots.  From Charles Vernon: To approach Spearhead, park at the Glacier Gorge junction trailhead and hike up the trail about 5 miles to Black Lake. From there, head east up an unmarked trail to tree-line, then contour over to the base of Spearheads NE face. The [North] Ridge route begins at the NW corner of the mountain. Be careful to chose the correct line at the start; parties have gotten off-route here onto much more difficult terrain. Look for a pronounced groove above a slab. Climb up through that and continue up easier grooves and slabs for several hundred feet, angling to the left. At that point you should reach the very crest of the ridge, and the prominent flake/pillar of the Barb should be visible down and to your left. These initial pitches are often simul-climbed, but most parties rope up here. Climb a shallow corner on beautiful rock right of the crest, traverse somewhat right and head up more cracks and corners to a belay (5.6). The final pitch head for an awkward, acute dihedral, also 5.6. The route-finding can be confusing on the upper ridge, although many lines are probably climbable. Mountaineering judgment is essential. The summit, a short [scramble] up to your left, is absolutely spectacular and totally worth a visit if the weather is good. Descend significantly to the southwest, to avoid getting cliffed, down slabs and scree until you can contour around to the base of the climb. ',\n",
       " 'A nice long route to do if you want more challenge than the Barb or Age Axe.  Good climbing, varied, and just enough excitment to keep you focused.  Easier than Statospear, the Feiges Direct on the Barb, and Spear Me The Details.  Not as popular as it deserves to be, I suspect due to the Eye of Mordor section which seeps in even the driest years.  My description differs from the guidebooks, particularly in how one accesses the Eye, the obvious eliptical feature in the lower left quadrant of the wall.   P1: From the left side of the wall climb a long easy pitch to a double ledge system.   P2: Continue up right a bit to the highest terrace, about even with the start of the Eye to your left.   P3: Climb up to an obvious left-diagonal crack in the slab (runout 5.8, a 2.5 Flex Friend placement can be found) which leads to the right side of the Eye of Mordor about a third of the way up it.  Continue to the top (wet) and a belay at 2 fixed pins.  Rated 5.9+ in guidebooks but perhaps solid 5.10.   P4: Follow 5.8 flakes up and slightly left, then belay on a large ledge well left at rap anchors (three raps to the ground).   P5: Now move back right 30 feet to a R-facing corner with a spot of 5.9 and 3 fixed pins.  Belay in a circular niche from 2.5 to 3.5\" cams.  P6: Move left on unprotected 5.8 or 5.9 face, then follow an easier crack to a stance at slings and 2 old bolts.   P7: Clip a bolt and do a difficult standup move off a flake to a second bolt.  Follow a long undercling left (5.10-), then up to a good ledge.   P8: Step left, then follow a nice crack system (5.9) to an overhang, step left, and head for the top.  ',\n",
       " 'This route is a fairly independent version of the East Prow, covering 2/3 pitches as new territory, and with different character and cruxes.  it was clean, fun, solid, and... protected enough to be reasonable, but not with a lot of gear.  P1. 5.7, 110\\'  Start up from the ground as for East Prow and do the right-leaning uncderclimb flake, turning it at the point and heading back left up onto a slanting ledge. A belay can be made here, or with a 70-80m rope, one can continue into P2 as we did.  An alternate P1 can probably be devised to make this climb a completely different/independent/new line, but this pitch is pretty cool.  P2. 5.9+, 120+\\' From the slanting ledge above P1, continue up in a right-facing corner past a large flake jutting out right. Stay left over this, heading for the left of these two corners, which goes more directly upward, instead of leaning right as for East Prow. Strike out up and left, (somewhat sharply left) from this left corner across a grey and gold granite plate. Place good protection prior to getting onto it, as protection will be hard to come by (only occasional) from here on. You will be linking small sectios of cracks and flakes through face-climbing sections.  Pull on small nobs and slopers pacing upward toward the left end of a roof where a right facing corner intersects it. The left-facing corner that holds the second belay of the East Prow should be visible maybe 15+ meters to your right as you place more gear and pull the roof. Continue climbing up and left into a left-facing flake system that leans left. This is visible in Rossiter\\'s photo in the Fixed Pin guide on p. 200 but is not shown as a flake in the topo on p. 201. Belay wherever you can get some gear, which may be after some simul-climbing unless you have at least a 70m rope. Due to lack of much gear, drag remains at a minimum. The climbing gets easier as you continue onto lower angle rock.  P3. 5.6, ???\\' (depends on where you belay). Finish out up and left on the left facing flake and shallow corner on lower angle rock.  When you can see a huge horn on the right side skyline, on a reasonable sized ledge, break right and head to that ledge to the right for a belay.  This is the 3rd belay as for Age Axe or East Prow.  P4-P6. 5.9+ or harder. Finish as for Awesome or Age Axe, just like you would on the East Prow. The P4 3\" crack above the horn is fun and takes whatever gear you brought in one place or another, and the P5/P6 of Age Axe (run them together) are a great right-facing corner 10b finish opportunity, though a little less clean than the rest of the climb.',\n",
       " 'This is a magical mystery tour. It has lots of variety including steep face climbing similar to the domes of Tuolumne Meadows.  There may be no better face climbing in the Park.  The route starts on Middle Earth, which can be accessed by various means.  P1. The first pitch of the route proper begins to the right of the Eye of Mordor, a huge, seriously sinister, vertical gouge left of center on Spearhead\\'s east face.  The first pitch is easy, taking you to a big ledge. The next pitch climbs straight up into an obvious dihedral, which grows wide at its top (5.9).  Not much gear toward the end, unless you brought a 12\" piece.  I did not but found that focused liebacking brought me to its top and the next big ledge.  P3. The third pitch heads left, through a hole, and onto a ramp.  Before heading too far along the ramp, climb up and through an overhang/flake, onto the next ledge which curves into a right-facing dihedral (5.10a).    P4. The fourth pitch heads up the dihedral, over a small roof and hand traverses left into another short dihedral.  Belay from slings towards its top (5.10c).  This is a cool pitch.  P5. Next, a thin hand crack in a short dihedral quickly turns into a short, somewhat horizontal, finger crack.  The crack dies into the sweeping wall above.  Figure out how to put your feet where your hands are and stand up onto a golden wall of knobs (crux).  Climb toward and ultimately onto a memorable flake and then up right toward a shallow, short dihedral (more cruxey climbing here as well).   Rossiter\\'s guide suggests belaying at the base of the dihedral.  I kept going and joined two pitches together into 165 feet of incredible climbing.  You will need lots of runners if you do this.  The next section heads up the dihedral, breaks out right into more wonderful face climbing and then into another shallow short dihedral, belaying at its top (5.11a/b).  Take a breather.  P6. The next pitch heads up a series of dihedrals.  Belay on top of the second one (5.8).  P7. You are now below the exit pitch.  The rock changes dramatically in character at this point but remains solid.  Clip a bolt, mince left toward a thin crack and get some smallish stoppers in it.  Then head straight up the crack to the summit (5.10b).',\n",

       " 'Named after the rogue-trickster Stone Monkey of 16th Century Asian literature, this climb provides one of the best difficult trad leads in RMNP.  On the left side of the wall find a 5.9 dihedral leading to Middle Earth ledge, or an easier variation just left of this (it is possible to third class to ME ledge in this area).  Climb an easy ramp that forms the right of two prominent dihedrals, belaying before a right-facing flake.  Climb the flake (5.9ish) to its top, then scratch right across a blank wall to a semi-hanging belay (good 5.10, no pro, exciting swinging opportunities for both the leader and second).  Climb the flake system up right and continue to a good ledge and belay.  Pitch 5 is the business, a 5.9 undercling to a right-facing corner which leads to the sustained, under-vertical tips crack (crux).  The climbing is more face climbing than a finger crack, although there are finger jams to be had - if you have tiny digits, you will be happy.  Small gear (many RPs), good shoes, and positive thinking will bring you to another nice belay ledge, with hard-to-find anchors but nice wildflowers.  Above is a longish 5.8 crack pitch which leads to easier climbing to exit.  Early season the crux crack can seep.  This has much average climbing, but the crux pitch is stellar.',\n",
       " 'Amazing! Spearhead is located in Rocky Mountain National Park and is perched above Glacier Gorge. Spearhead is an 800 foot granite buttress that rises to a sharp point above the upper basin (past Black Lake). In the middle of the immense vertical wall is a right-arcing crescent roof dubbed the \"Sickle\". Syke\\'s Sickle is a wonderful route that ascends several crack systems before arriving at the \"Sickle\".   P1 ascends a 5.5, left-arcing, wide crack (easy to spot in the center of the wall), then unites with a flaky system that moves up and left (watch rope drag) before ending 200 feet up on a ledge to the left of a blocky roof (bypass the weathered webbing for the \\xc2\\x93standard\\xc2\\x94 first belay).   P2 crosses the \"flat earth\" (a 35-degree grassy ledge) with an easy dihedral before ascending a 35-foot slab, with no protection, to a nice [flake]- don\\'t fall (this is the most direct, and exciting, way to the [flake] system above)!   P3 moves diagonally left (past slings) then ascends hollow and loose flakes up an amazing wall with great exposure and fun aesthetic moves (pass the upper slings and set up camp 20 feet higher on a \"nice\" horn below a large dihedral). If in doubt, go to the highest 3rd/4th class part of the ramp, until you are below a dihedral and \"real\" climbing.  P4 starts the business- 40 foot of great dihedral, then everything goes vertical, to the right, with sidepulls, stemming, and fun moves for another 50 feet (5.7+).   P5 gets a little crazy: move up into a wide crack, then make a relatively thin face traverse, to your right, before rising high on a one foot thick OW flack that starts vertical then bends right and ends 10 feet below a nice ledge with a huge, loose block (the book says 5.7, if so - it was a very hard 5.7).   P6 is the crux (the book says 5.9.... I thought it was solid 5.10a ). (Note: keep in mind: you are well over six hundred and fifty feet off the ground and below an amazing roof that cuts out then daggers down). The view is absolutely incredible! You are on a beautiful wall (Spearhead is the smallest peak amongst the surrounding spires). The valley is painted with golden aspen, evergreen trees, bright red bushes, and turquoise lakes. At eye level there is an array of jagged peaks that jut forth from a wrapped ridgeline. It\\'s so awe inspiring: everything is sharp and edgy and very intense.   The \"crux\" starts with a nice 20-foot dihedral that intersects the roof (great pro w/ two good fixed pieces at the roof intersection). Time to get to work...move out above a void of space, stem, place big gear (the crack above takes large cam), stem some more, fist jam, then pull through the roof slot to a huge edge. Looking down into the void, from the stemming position, is wicked cool! For the sanity of your second - slot a fat nut above the apex of the slot exit and remove your #3 - #4 cam placement from the crack (this increases rope drag but makes the crux more enjoyable for your second). Ride the edge above the abyss for about 40 feet, on easy rock, and set-up a belay.   P7 continues up the left-leaning crack system a short way.Place pro as high as you can (I put it under a flake just to the right of the system), then climb down a little and traverse right and up a little for ~20 feet until you come to the bolt (which has recently been replaced). As you are climbing up the crack system, make sure to take your time and look to the right for the bolt, which is very hard to spot, especially from where you need to start the traverse. Unfortunately, the hardest move on the pitch comes just before you clip the bolt, but it is no harder than 5.8 at the very most. After you clip the bolt, head up and right on easier climbing into a dihedral and then step right around an overhang to third class terrain. This pitch is not really dangerous for the second.

(60 feet, 5.10d/11a) This is historically rated 5.10c. Locate a thin crack shooting up the slab that joins a left-facing roof/dihedral. The crux is at the 10-12 foot level where you have to fiddle in small gear from a marginal stance. An extra yellow and gray Alien will sew up the upper finger crack. Your lieback and gear placement skills will be tested on this pitch. Belay on the right side of the ledge.  P3.

       " \"This route was just recently published in Bernard Gillett's new guide to the High Peaks.  This book and its companion volume to the Estes Park region are well worth getting.  Both provide previously unpublished routes, up-to-date descent info, grade indexes, and nice presentations.  They are very professional and polished books.  I like carrying both Gillett and Rossiter route descriptions along, sometimes a 2nd opinion is welcome.  Gillett certainly talks this route up, so I felt I should go and check it out.  While I didn't think that it was as great as Gillett obviously does, it would make a good alternative to the well traveled Culp-Bossier (which undoubtedly motivated Gillett's assessment at least partially.)  I'm not sure if it's better than Love (haven't done that one), but it's about as good at Culp-Bossier.  From the start of Love Route and Culp-Bossier, step up left to a grassy ledge (left of the huge, right-facing corner).  You will see a couple right-facing dihedrals above.  P1 Climb/wander to the bottom of the left right-facing dihedral. (5.6)  P2 Climb the dihedral above.  Avoid the roof by climbing the thin face on the left.  The upper half is nice stemming and a dirty crack. Great pitch.  (5.8)  P3 I tried climbing the headwall directly, but after ripping off a pizza pan sized flake, I got a little freaked, backed off, and stepped left to bypass the steep stuff.  I recommend the latter.  (5.5)  P4 Climb a shorter easy pitch up to a ledgy area and set a belay at a comfortable spot.  (5.4)  P5 Above you should see a large pillar (~100 foot high) on the face.  Climb the left side of this to a small ledge at a right-facing and -leaning corner/flake.  This is another fantastic pitch.  (5.7)  P6 Things get a little confusing here.  Climb the flake/corner above to where it bends back left.  From here, break out right across the face and belay wherever you can get a good anchor.  This is a shorter pitch.  P7 This is the mental crux of the route, and is something of a route-finding challenge.  From my partner's A5 belay, I ran it out straight up mostly unprotected and steep 5.7+ ground towards an obvious roof/overlap.  I didn't protect the step over the roof because I didn't trust the rock that much.  Shortly past this, you will reach a small ledge.  Follow a right leaning corner/ramp up to the bottom of an obvious, left-facing corner.  (5.8ish, standard Hallett death pitch)  P8 Climb the corner, run it out across a nice 5.8- face, trend left, then hop up a steep left facing corner to the right.  If rope drag hasn't stopped you yet, go to the summit.  Otherwise, belay, and do one more brief scramble/pitch to the top.  You will cross over the Love Route on P6.  The Gillett topo doesn't show the pillar on P5, but the belay point is accurately depicted.  His written description of P6 didn't jive with our experience, but our climb pretty much matched the topo.  Also, Gillett and Rossiter describe somewhat different lines for the Love Route.  Once on the summit, head east down the ridge for a couple hundred feet.  Stay close to the crest, and near the east side of the First Buttress (the route is on the Second Buttress) you will come to a bolted rappel (could use a modern bolt).  One rope will get you to a second short rappel, or a 60m rope will get you to easy scrambling terrain.  Scramble down the gully for a few hundred feet.  Then, head left over a rise, and aim for a scree gully.  Follow this to the base of the Hallett Chimney (between 1st and 2nd Buttresses.)  If you racked up here in the morning (near the mossy area) you won't need to walk the couple minutes back up to the base of the routes. \",\n",
       " \"This route ascends the middle of the 1st buttress of Hallett Peak.  It is characterized as a right-facing dihedral system that winds its way up three pitches through the headwall of the 1st Buttress.  From a distance, the dihedral system is clearly visible just to the left of a very large roof.  Though primarily a scramble over moderate terrain, the 1st two technical pitches are good, and the position of the last pitch is spectacular featuring an off-width crack that has great exposure.  There are numerous starts to this climb and others to the left of it on the 1st Buttress.  Most of the starts can be referenced from the base of Hallet Chimney.  Easy ramps lead up and to the left.  As the ledges are climbed, weaknesses will appear, leading upward to the right, into the bowels of the face.  Chose your path.  The goal is to reach a series of ledges in the middle section of the face described as the white bands.  Lower angled slabs with cracks and the occasional shallow corner mostly characterize the climbing found on the initial pitches.  Don't worry about being off-route as there are multiple ways to go.  The best start would be to do the initial pitches of the Great Dihedral.  Eventually scramble up to the highest of the ledges in the white bands, about 100 feet left of Hallett Chimney.  P1. From the ledge, locate a short mungy looking spot that will allow little resistance for getting into a left facing dihedral above.  This should shortly end and you should climb up a right facing dihedral to gain a small ledge at the base of a much larger right facing dihedral.  5.4.  P2. Chimney up the very wide, right facing dihedral above to gain the top of a little pillar.  5.5.  P3. Face climb to the base of a shallow, right-facing dihedral system.  Span from right to left across the wide crack and climb on the face of the outside edge of the dihedral.  The exposure here is very nice.  Scramble over easy ground to the top of the buttress.  5.6.  For a descent, it is best to use the East Ridge.  You are very close to it when you top out on this route.  Head left or downhill, following the cliff top.  Look for cairns.  The cairns lead to a set of chain anchors.  One 100 foot rappel will lead to ground that is safe to scramble down.  Follow cairns down towards the low spot in the ridge.  Look for a very faint path leading off to the left.  There should be cairns marking the way.  At all costs avoid getting into the obvious snow or scree gully that is in front of you.  Eventually a small col will be encountered where the option exists for easily dropping into the ugly snow or scree gully mentioned before, or turning to the left and having a delightful trot down ledge systems that make up the lower section of the 1st Buttress.  Cairns mark most of the way and after a while it becomes obvious which way to go.  This descent brings you back out at the base of Hallett Chimney.  \",\n",
       " \"This is a meandering journey up the north face of the third buttress, topping out at its highest point.  To locate the base, pass under the queue of folks on the 2nd buttress, and swim your way up scree past the rockfall, aiming towards the saddle, and a small, separated tower from the main wall. Before reaching the tower, keep your eyes peeled for a large, left-facing dihedral that stays wet most of the season. 40 feet right is an obvious hand crack stretching up through a bulge and out of sight.

Either snake to the left of the tower, and across the notch, or straight up the small gendarmed tower, and rap to the notch off slings. Belay at a left-facing dihedral that leads to the final, striking, finger crack.  P6. 5.9, 70'. Move the belay up the corner system 60' to the base of the splitter. Straight up the crack past a fixed nut, then cut left at the upper headwall (which goes at 5.10c R), along ramps, then top out directly above the crack. Marvel at the beautiful face to your left, resembling some of the best of Red Rocks, Nevada sandstone.  Descent: 2 raps from slings at the summit, a couple hundred yards down the [gully], then escape onto the face at your right, meandering down 4th class ledges until you nail the top of pitch one.

The leader should be confident on 5.8 as routefinding is hard, and many pitches are runout at 5.6.  Follow the Rossiter guidebook description to find the route.  Per C. Vernon:  P1-Climb up light colored rock, head up a left-leaning corner a short ways, traverse right on a ledge to a short thin crack, and climb that to another ledge (5.6, 140 feet).  P2-Go up past rappel slings, turn a roof and head up and LEFT into a nice right facing corner (the middle of three such corners). Belay at the bottom of the corner (5.6, 120 feet).  Be sure to traverse LEFT to the larger dihedral - going straight up the smaller dihedral above the roof is much harder.  There are several sets of bail slings to the right - don't get sucked over there.  P3-Climb the corner, traverse right on a ramp past fixed pins, pass a bulge and climb past more pins to a belay on a ledge (5.8, 160 feet).  P4-Head sharply left on easier, broken terrain to a huge grassy ledge on the left side of a prow.   P5-Continue left of a blunt prow for 140 feet of outstanding face climbing, but beware of a loose block in mid pitch (5.6).   P6-Traverse out of a left-leaning corner and angle up slightly right to a belay below a right-facing corner (5.6, 140 feet, runout).  P7-Climb the face to the left of the corner (somewhat dicey), and head straight up extremely exposed cracks with decent pro to an easier section (5.8, 140 feet).   P8-Continue straight up cracks towards a large roof, which you will leave on your left. Traverse out right and climb the face to avoid some dirty looking overhangs, reaching easier ground and then a very loose summit (5.8, 80-100 feet).\\nThe fastest descent is a rappel and downclimb down the first buttress, to the east of this route.  Hike about 1/3 mile down the ridgeline (maybe 200 vertical feet), pass the first major incut gully (which faces north) and then go down another 50-60 vertical feet, 400 feet or so of horizontal walking. Look for the cairns marking the rappel to your left (northeast). Rap one 60m drop if you have two ropes, or two 30m drops to a ledge. Downclimb the sections below you, then follow the cairns as the wrap around to the left (to the north, and then to the west, back towards the beginning of the climb).  You will NOT be going down the huge gully to the right (east), which looks very tempting.  You will end up a couple hundred feet below the start of the route (5 minutes back to the base).\",\n",
       " \"This is one of the Park's hidden gems--it never sees any traffic, but I thought it was as good as the classic, well-traveled Culp-Bossier route.  Expect a bit more loose stuff, though.  Perhaps the crowds are also scared away by the 5.10a rating in all the guides--don't be.  The crux pitch is clearly easier (all 3 other people I know who've done the route think it is 5.9 at most, and the line we did exactly matched that of the guidebooks), and on average, with the exception of P1, all the pitches feel about a grade easier than the guidebooks' ratings.  Overall it feels a tiny bit harder than Culp-Bossier.  The protection is good but not great; practically all the crux sections are pro-at-your-feet affairs.  The upper pitches have wonderfully exposed and juggy 5.8 climbing.  Several features should point one in the desired direction to find the start of the route, which is probably the trickiest route-finding of the day.  Hike past the start to Culp-Bossier and Jackson-Johnson, to a huge, long, right-facing corner.  Several smaller corners exist to the right of this; the route begins in the third corner (all smaller) to the right of this feature.  Right of this lies a large white spot in a smooth shield of rock (not to be confused with the much larger site of recent rockfall on the Third Buttress). From here it is quite difficult to tell where the crux pitch goes, but step back well away from the cliff until fixed slings are visible above the P1 corner's top.  The crux pitch begins just left of these.    Scramble up to a steep slope below and left of the intial corner and set the belay as high as possible on third class ground.  P1 - climb up rightwards into the corner and follow it, but branch right into another corner(5.8) when possible and continue up nebulous terrain above to the ledge with fixed slings, or just below it (full rope-length or possibly longer).  P2 - moving the belay to the base of the crux corner (past the fixed slings) is highly recommended.  The pitch starts up a shallow, RF and right-arching corner, traverses right past a pin (just above a hollow flake) to another shallow, indistinct RF corner, and ascends this.  NOTE: the guidebooks indicate this pitch continuing to a ledge, but there are NO GOOD ANCHORS on this ledge.  I strongly advise setting a hanging belay just after the crux on easier terrain where there is still good gear! Alternatively, it might be possible to continue into the next pitch with a 60 or 70 meter rope and reach good anchors (but note that the next pitch doesn't have very good pro to start).  P3 - continue up to a large sloping ledge (the belay in the guidebooks--a fixed rappel anchor is also visible off-route, about 50 feet down to the right), and climb nebulous, somewhat dicey 5.6 corners up and slightly right to another ledge.  Traverse right along this ledge and set a belay after a long pitch (about 100 feet or so right of a huge, right-facing corner, with a wide crack, that marks the right edge of the huge pillar on Jackson-Johnson).  P4 - traverse up into a right-facing, left-leaning 5.5 corner, and climb that to a belay near its top (above a prominent hollow flake on the right, but still below the top of the J-J pillar to the left)--another long pitch.  P5 - traverse right (somewhat loose) to a roof, and follow the obvious juggy weakness through and up to a belay ledge (100 feet, 5.8).  P6 - nice 5.8 leads straight up before the crack system jogs considerably right to a belay on a large sloping ledge, fantastic exposure the whole way.  P7 - continue up the right-leaning system, 5.7 or 5.8, for a long but not sustained pitch ending in a broken area on the very edge of the Second Buttress (good views of the Slit).  P8 - cut sharply back left on easy but loose ground and finish with neat climbing through an obvious 5.6 notch (the left and larger of two).  Belay from boulders on the summit ridge.  Head up the ridge a short ways to find the descent gully.  \",\n",
       " \"Englishman's Route climbs the upper half of the 2nd buttress on Hallett.  The most direct approach to Englishman's Route is to climb the bottom half of Better Than Love, but one could climb the Love Route, Culp-Bossier, or Hesse-Ferguson.  From the ground, you can see a big, black, right-leaning crack above the white band that divides Hallett in half and to the right of the roof on the Love Route.  The crack looks wet and it was wet when I did it. Fortunately, you stay to the right of this feature on beautiful face holds thus staying dry.  This description only includes the pitches from the white band to the top.  Set your belay high up the white band or be willing to simul-climb or stop short of the belay I describe (there is another belay, slings on a chockstone in the big black crack with a sloping stance).  P1. Work your way to the crack then follow face holds and intermittent cracks on the face to the right of the big black crack. Positive holds lead to a nice but small belay (big nut and medium cam).  Pro is good but like all routes in the area, it's a little run out.  P2. The next pitch follows more of the same holds but in the middle of the pitch you will have to traverse to the big black crack to find pro (#2 & #3 Camalots.)  The pitch moves right with the crack until you come to an overlap.  Crank over the overlap and establish a belay up and left.  One could also go straight up or traverse right to other routes but we followed the photo from Scott Kimball's book.    P3. From here, it was one long pitch to the top with a 60m rope.  We went left up a small, right-facing corner for 10 feet then traversed left on face holds under a small roof until arriving at a small left-facing corner.  Sparse pro but more of those delightful face holds.  The left-facing corner leads to the top but is broken up with a few ledges and a little more face climbing.  Watch out for rope drag or break the pitch into two.  I felt that all of the pitches were a grade easier then what is given in the guidebooks.  You just have to piece together the face holds correctly.  The 5.8 pitch on Better Than Love was the crux of our day.  Excellent rock, nice belays and killer exposure.  It is a good choice if you have done the other classics on Hallett or if those routes are crowded.\",\n",
       " \"This route description just pertains to the upper pitches of the 1st Buttress of Hallett Peak.  Reach the ledges dividing the lower and upper section of this buttress.  You can get here via Great Dihedral, lower pitches of the Standard Route, even via the ledges off of the descent route.  My party ended up here after we mistakenly did the first few pitches of Better than Love and traversed across Hallett's Chimney.  The route climbs the obvious corner system between the Standard Route (left) and the Center Route (right).  Can be climbed in two long pitches with a 60m rope with a semi-hanging belay before a second small roof.  The first pitch was fun standard Hallett affair.  Much of the second pitch after the small roof entailed avoiding climbing inside a wide wet mossy crack.  If dry, this pitch might be easier to climb and protect.\",\n",
       " 'This is a fun moderate on the first buttress of Hallett Peak.  To find the start, locate Hallett Chimney, AI5 M5 which separates the first and second buttresses.  About 40-50 feet left of this chimney, on the right side of the first buttress, locate a huge, right-facing dihedral.  The left face of the bottom corner section has a beautiful hand and fist crack arcing up and right into the corner.  This crack goes at about 5.6/7 and is sweet.    Rack up below this corner and scramble up and right to a nice ledge to start the climb.  Work up and left to gain the dihedral.  Continue up the series of right facing dihedrals and chimneys for 2 to 3 pitches.  If you have a 200 foot rope, there are great belay ledges at 195 feet for two pitches and you end up about mid-height on the buttress where you can scramble up to the next section on the face and choose a finish.  Scope out your finish before you leave the ground as the lines are difficult to discern once on the wall.',\n",
       " \"This is my favorite route on Hallett Peak.  It is demanding both physically and mentally.  The run-outs epitomize what climbing on Hallett Peak is all about, and it has some burly, physical cruxes.  It shares the same start as the Love Route and the Englishman's Route.  As with all routes on Hallett Peak, route finding and intricate gear placing skills are important.  See the big white spot with the obvious roof at the top in the picture below.  The Hesse-Ferguson goes up the white spot and climbs through the roof on pitch 3 or so.  The following description is how we climbed the route, although there are many other possible variations to this route on almost every pitch.  Pitch 1 - Locate a pink band of rock to the left of a giant, right-facing dihedral.  Climb through the pink band and go up a grassy, right-facing dihedral to a nice ledge with slings available for a belay.  160 feet, 5.6.  Pitch 2 - Step left from the belay ledge and face climb up to another ledge.  Step right and continue up a left facing dihedral to a white roof that blocks the way.  The dihedral starts out with a left facing and a right facing side with a crack on both sides, but the right facing side peters out eventually.  Climb around the right side of the roof and make a belay with very small gear.  Alternatively, go straight up the dihedral from the belay ledge until the left facing dihedral is reached and continue up to a belay above the white roof and to the right.  There will be a slung block just below the belay where a retreat anchor has been placed.  200 feet, 5.8.  Pitch 3 - Climb a slab up and left, above the belay, to reach the bottom of a giant, left facing dihedral.  Get into the dihedral and climb it to the top, beneath a giant, squared-off roof.  It is possible to belay directly under the giant, squared-off roof.  Climb out the bomb bay roof on the right side, and layback around the outside corner to get to face climbing on the right.  Go straight up to reach a big terrace that is at mid height on the cliff and belay.  30 feet of slab climbing to the dihedral leads to 100 plus feet of climbing from the base of the dihedral, through the roof, and up to the terrace.  5.9 for the roof and 5.8 serious on the slab below the dihedral.  Pitch 4 - Climb straight up from the terrace, aiming for a small roof.  The gear up to the roof is decent enough.  Above the roof, either continue up over insanely run out face climbing (yucky) to a belay on a flake, or traverse up and right to join a left facing dihedral on the Culp-Bossier and belay at the top of the dihedral (better).  200 feet, 5.7 serious or very serious depending on the chosen path.  Pitch 5 - Continue face climbing up to the base of a white band and belay either at the base of the white band or go down and to the left for a few feet to a better belay.  150 to 200 feet, 5.8.  Pitch 6 - Climb up the left side of the white band through some small, acrobatic roofs and a shallow right-facing dihedral, heading to the top.  The only fixed piton on the route is encountered in the first roof.  Belay where convenient. This is the best pitch on the route as we climbed it.  5.9.  Pitch 7 - Continue up to the top if the rope ran out on the previous pitch.  5.8, serious.  It is possible to traverse up and right to join the Culp-Bossier from the base of the white band at the top of pitch 5.  The entire route contains many variations and most of the pitches seem to be longer than indicated in the Richard Rossiter Rocky Mountain National Park guide to the High Peaks - 1997.  The [Gillett] guide generally matches the same description.  Bring large nuts and a friend.  If your head is on right, this is a wonderful route up the middle of the 2nd buttress.  It is definitely worth the finagling it takes to figure it out.\",\n",
       " 'This is a great two pitch variation \"In Between\" the Hesse-Ferguson and the Culp-Bossier.  Start with the Hesse-Ferguson for its first long pitch.    1) From the grassy ledge, step right into a white, right-facing dihedral and climb to its top below a large roof band.  Turn the roof on the left side, then make a spicey traverse above the roof\\'s lip approximately 50 feet to the right and belay around an arete in a hanging, right-facing corner.  This pitch is sustained 5.8, and the traverse offers one place for protection (which used to have a #2.5 Friend fixed under a flake about midway through).  The quality of the traverse is superb, but it takes a good head and some route-finding to link the correct edges and nubbins.  (5.8 S, 165 feet).  2) Climb the beautiful, hanging, right-facing corner above you, with awesome stemming and fingerlocks, and take the pitch to the large terrace at mid-height on the wall.

       " 'This addition to the Second Buttress on Hallett combines a few old pitches with some new ones to create a striking line up this classic alpine rock face.  The 110\\' long second pitch is the crux as it ascends increasingly steeper, striped rock to a 5-bolt protected, pumpy section on the left side of the striking arete just 50\\' right of the classic Culp-Bossier.  These are the only bolts on the route, not including the two originals encountered on the last pitch that is the finish of the Jackson-Johnson.

There is a green double sling as of 5/16/12.

P7 - 5.9+ (60m) Climb a steep quartz crack out of the ramp end then back left into an obvious right-facing dihedral which is the Jackson-Johnson finish with two ancient bolts.

       " \"This is not as good as the neighboring Culp-Bossier, but it is still a worthwhile route on a sublime alpine wall.  More of a mountaineering route than Culp-Bossier, it wanders around finding the path of least resistance until running smack into a superb, exposed 5.9 pitch at the top.  The middle section of this route is often simul-climbed and overall, I'd say its the easier of the two routes.  To approach, park at the Bear Lake trailhead and hike for a mile and a half on well-marked trails to Emerald Lake.  Hallett's Northeast face looms overhead, and if you're lucky, you'll be just in time for alpenglow.  Scramble up above the left side of the lake to the base of the face, aiming for the second of three distinct buttresses.  A vague prow divides the upper part of the second buttress in half; the route starts directly below this prow, about fifty feet to the right of a huge, broken, corner system.  P1 - climb up light-colored 5.6 rock and enter a prominent, right-facing, left leaning dihedral. After 30 feet or so, traverse right, climb a short crack, and belay on a ledge (5.6, 140 feet).  P2 - climb up past rappel slings, follow a crack over a roof, and head right across a slab to a belay (5.6, 120 feet).  P3 - traverse right around the corner on easy rock, go up an easy groove, and stretch out the rope into a recessed area (low fifth class).   P4 - continue up and right on broken terrain to the base of a giant flake/pillar (with a yellowish tint when viewed from the ground).    P5 - climb the corner formed by the pillar's left side in one long 200 foot pitch or two short pitches (5.6).  P6 - from  the ledge atop the pillar, cut back sharply left up a corner system, passing a confusing section of down-climbing in mid-pitch (5.6, 160 feet).  Belay on another good ledge.

P7 - climb the beautiful corner above the ledge past old pitons and worthless bolts--your own pro will give you more confidence--and belay on a ledge at its top (5.9, 130 feet).  P8 - a short, meandering 50 feet finds the top of the wall.  Descent: the easiest way involves hiking up talus until a gully appears leading down to the northwest.  Follow it down to the base of the cliff (bearing left about 2/3 of the way to avoid getting cliffed).

I really [couldn\\'t] recommend this route to anyone except for the rare and elusive [Hallett] junky. Although it does have its moments.   P 1- Find a right-leaning slot 50m up and and ways to the right of the Northcutt-Carter rock scar. Work your way up to some old slings [visible] from the ground.  P2 - Choose the wide crack to the right or the roof straight above. We took the roof and found it quite enjoyable. Solid 5.8.

This would be great climbing except that nearly every hold is loose. 5.8. The 5.9+ R variation to the left of these pitches looked like perfect rock and excellent but runout climbing.  P4 and 5 - Finesse your way up the chimney for two pitches bringing you to a steep headwall ending the chimney system.  P6 - Take the not so pretty crack/groove on the right in the back of the chimney and continue up 30 more feet ending on top of a small spire of sorts. 5.9.  Now, I [don\\'t] know if Gillett or Rossitter have done this route, but the topos are a bit off here. From the belay after the chimney, one must rap 30 feet to a ledge and then start p.7 (or p.8 on the topo).  P7 - My favorite pitch on the climb. Head up easy rock to the obvious thin crack splitting a headwall. Clip a fixed nut and dare to yard on a loose chockstone to enter easier terrain. 5.9. Cool finger crack!   This climb is probably not as bad as I make it sound. It may be a better climb overall if the 5.9 R variation was taken on pitches 3 and 4.

There has been much history about this route.  Once, it carried a somber reputation of a fear-inducing North Wall.  However, a couple Californians came to erase that reputation with an afternoon ascent.  In its former state, it provided a great, moderate line up the 3rd buttress.  With the rock fall which changed the first 2 pitches in the late 1990s, this route\\'s start increased in difficulty to the 5.10 R range.

       " 'On the left side of the upper headwall of First Buttress is a prominent tower that has no documented routes, though it undoubtedly has been climbed before (we found a new rappel sling around a flake on top). The tower requires a rappel to escape, dropping you at the foot of the rappels from the standard east ridge descent.  We climbed the right side of the tower\\'s main face in three short pitches, starting in a little alcove about 40 feet left of the upper Standard Route. A short, wandering face pitch (5.7?) led to the top of a cool flake/ledge (the far left side of this flake forms the huge roof you can see from Emerald Lake). After a couple of false starts on the left, we started the second pitch from the right side of this flake; you probably could more easily reach this point from the right. A steep finger crack leads to overlaps about 15 feet above the ledge. Climb the crack and the arete/face above with good holds and decent pro to a nice ledge about 100 feet up (5.8+?). The third pitch starts on a steep gray face left of the stance and angles slightly left to finish just right of the big roof band at the top of \"Point Five Buttress\" (125 feet, 5.6).

It combines the Hesse-Ferguson, Culp-Bossier, and Jackson-Johnson for a nice tour.  Two characteristics define the common Hallett experience: route finding is very difficult, particularly the higher you go; and the corollary, that with enough mental fortitude one can climb anywhere on this wall.  This combination takes advantage of these qualities and offers several excellent pitches up to 5.9. It is perhaps the longest route possible on this part of the wall.    Begin 20m right of the Love Route corner, on a ledge at the base of a right-facing corner (FP).  P1: Climb the corner (long pitch).

It is characterized as a broken dihedral system that climbs two pitches up the side of the headwall of the 1st Buttress. From a distance, the climb is visible as a series of weaknesses on the left side of the headwall. Though primarily a scramble over moderate terrain, the technical climbing at the top is fun to climb.  There are numerous starts to this climb and others on the left side of the 1st Buttress. Most of the starts can be referenced from the base of Hallett Chimney. Easy ramps lead up and to the left. As the ledges are climbed, weaknesses will appear, leading upward to the right, into the bowels of the face. Chose your path. The goal is to reach a series of ledges in the middle section of the face described as the white bands. Lower angled slabs with cracks and the occasional shallow corner mostly characterize the climbing found on the initial pitches. Don't worry about being off-route as there are multiple ways to go. The best start would be to do the initial pitches of the Great Dihedral. Eventually scramble up to the highest of the ledges in the white bands.  Scramble up and left across a broken face and large blocks to reach a grassy ledge on the lower right side base of a prominent tower.  Climb 2 pitches up the left most of two, right-facing dihedrals.  The dihedral can be climbed on both sides and finishes on the right with interesting face climbing through loose blocks.  Scramble over easy ground to the top of the buttress. 5.5.  For a descent, it is best to use the East Ridge. You are on top of  it when you top out on this route. Head left and look for cairns. The cairns lead to a set of chain anchors. One 100 foot rappel will lead to ground that is safe to scramble down. Follow cairns down towards the low spot in the ridge. Look for a very faint path leading off to the left. There should be cairns marking the way. At all costs, avoid getting into the obvious snow or scree gully that is in front of you. Eventually a small col will be encountered where the option exists for easily dropping into the ugly snow or scree gully mentioned before, or turning to the left and having a delightful trot down ledge systems that make up the lower section of the 1st Buttress. Cairns mark most of the way and after a while it becomes obvious which way to go. This descent brings you back out at the base of Hallett Chimney.\",\n",

Not sure if anyone has been able to exactly follow the route description below but then again, it is Hallett where even the best can get lost.- Eli)  This addition to Hallett\\'s North Face involves 6 new pitches just left of the classic Direct Second Buttress route.  Four of the six pitches were done as 60m rope stretchers.  The fourth pitch ascends the striking right facing dihedral which is the right side of the \"Big Yellow Flake\" which the Jackson-Johnson climbs on its left side.  This route stays left of the Kor Route by 50\\' to 100\\' throughout its duration and is a relative a directissima up the wall.  P1 - 30m, 5.9.

P3 - 60m, 5.9. Climb a splitter finger crack out of the belay up and right, stepping right after 30\\' into a shallow dihedral which heads straight up on steep juggy large flakes (mostly attached) into the very large, right-facing corner of the yellow flake - worth stretching the rope here as it brings one to a very large, comfortable ledge on the white band.  P4 - 60m, 5.8. Climb the striking,right-facing dihedral of the yellow flake and hold on tight!  On the FA this was done as 5.8(X).  A few large Camalots would bring this down to an (R) rating.  After a ledge, continue to the top of the Yellow Flake Tower which has another spacious ledge system on top.  P5 - 60m, 5.9. Step down and right off the top of the Yellow Flake and follow a crack system up for 50\\' into a white quartz crack.

Head straight up the obvious weakness, aiming for a pin in a shallow, left-facing corner up and right. Clip this pin, move up and right out of the corner and commit to a healthy, albeit easy, runout to the line of bolts marking the crux of this pitch, ending at a two bolt belay below a roof, 11c.  Pitch 2. Get some thin gear to start in a shallow corner right off the belay, then take another deep breath as you commit to the slabby features leading to the first bolt 20 feet above. A hidden piton below it gives a welcome surprise. The bolts get close together, you know what that means. After the crux, some more engaged runouts lead to another bolted belay, 5.12.  Pitch 3. You guessed it, another runout to the first bolt (much easier than the first two)! Follow the bolts to the crux arete sequence, then venture up the easier crack/ledge system to a single bolt belay, 5.11.  Pitch 4.

Probably a good climb if you\\'ve done everything else in the area, but I think the Casual Route is a way better climb at the grade (and not too much longer).  Approach: From Chasm Lake you can clearly identify the long 5.7 ramp of the first pitch and the 10c dihedral/pillar above.  Actually, you can pretty much see every pitch.  Scramble in from the left up 4th class ledges to the very base of the first pitch - there is a big grassy ledge here.  If you stop any sooner, you\\'ll probably end up having to simul-climb some to reach the first belay.  P1: Climb a long, exposed, left-trending ramp (5.7) to a ledge at the base of a nice finger crack in an obvious right-facing dihedral.  Depending on your choice of second pitches, belay here at a ring pin, or step left around the corner, walk along a narrow ledge, and belay at below a small roof and perfect hand crack in a second right-facing corner.  This is a long pitch.  P2 (Option 1):  The first option you come to.  Take the striking finger crack up the gradually-steepening corner.  Belay up and left.  5.10c/d.  P2 (Option 2):  Around the corner, take the really nice hand crack for 30 feet, then continue up a strange dihedral/chimney for another 25 feet.  5.8.  P3: The rumored \"death flake\" pitch.  Climb up and left off the belay and up into a six-inch crack that is formed by the margins of two huge flakes.  Both of these flakes are hollow, but neither felt like they were \"about to go.\"  Nevertheless, I kept my pro in the left (and better of the two).  Climb these flakes with combinations of jamming and liebacking (all very secure), and then stand up onto the top of the righthand flake: this is perhaps the scariest moment - the flake is approx. 45\\' high, 8\\' wide, and 1-2\\' thick, and only attached at its base.  Historically the belay is from slings around the top of this flake and a 1/4\" bolt above, but I avoided tying myself to such a massive piece of granite by not clipping the slings and climbing another 15 feet up to a nice stance in a small right-facing corner.  Here you can belay off a knife blade pin, a second 1/4 bolt, and bomber wires.  All in all probably 5.9.  P4: Head up the shallow right-facing corner to the left-hand edge of a very obvious roof and perform a difficult move stepping right and up under the roof.  One more difficult sequence involving underclings and a stem out right.  The hanging belay off fixed wires at the right end of the roof feels kinda like cheating - you\\'re sorta still in the last throws of the crux section - but what can ya do?  A short pitch; 5.10-.  P5: Pull the roof and up a difficult and continuous right-facing corner.  Climb all the way up to a big loose, ledge in the black band at the top of Chasm View wall.  5.10-.  P6: Traverse right for 100\\'.  Belay almost at the very end of the ledge below a left-facing dihedral with a crack in the upper half.  4th class but exposed and loose in one spot.  P7: Climb up the corner to the start of the crack, then traverse right for 35\\' on positive foot ledges and jugs.  Continuing straight up the crack is supposedly 9+, heading right is 5.6ish.',\n",
       " \"The East Face of Long's, crowned by the Diamond, is a world famous alpine wall, and every other aspect of Long's holds wonderful secret and not-so-secret scrambles and climbs.  This is my, and many other people's favorite mountain--Please, Please, Please tread as lightly as you can on this mountain! I am somewhat wary of writing anything that could increase traffic, though hopefully all this beta will decrease rescues. The peak sees thousands of ascents every year and the East Face is starting to feel like the Boulder Rock Club.  You can do yourself and everyone else a favor by climbing on weekdays.  The Diamond free-climbing season generally runs from mid-July to mid-September.The rap route on the Diamond off the left side on D7 is becoming very crowded, and I have seen parties ascending D7 become the victims of whiplash. Rude people are just as numerous on the Diamond as anywhere else. The raps start just below Table Ledge, directly above D7 . Nearly all of the anchors (all bolted, 5 in total) are slightly to one side or another--rappel slowly. The Crack of Delight rappels (total of 4) are also all from bolts and thankfully do not actually occur in the North Chimney; they start at the edge of Broadway below the Casual Route (near a Lower East Face route called Crack of Delight  - which is South of the North Chimney).  Make sure you head far enough climber's left on the first rappel.  If you are at slings and not bolts, you are off-route and your rope will get stuck! Again, rappel slowly.  I prefer to walk off from Table Ledge (not least because when we rappelled, it didn't really feel like we had completed the climb).  Once on Kiener's, head steadily up right to find the fourth class step around--if it seems harder, try somewhere else.  From the summit (or just above the step around), contour to the north (should not exceed 3rd class or present any exposure) to pick up some cairns which lead to the North Face rappel, off the huge eyebolts which used to anchor the cables (one double or two single rope raps).  Head out to the Boulderfield and the trail, or hike down the ridge to Mount Lady Washington (above the Chasm View Wall) until you can descend down talus slopes to the south.  Look for a loose gully (the Camel gully) which bears to the right and desposits you on the talus/scree/snow above Chasm Lake.  One can also take the Keyhole (hiking) route down from the summit--follow the sign and paint splotches on the rocks.  If you have rappeled D7, you traverse climber's right to the Crack of Delight rappels across the loose and sloping Broadway.  Note, that Crack of Delight is South of the North Chimney.  See photo. For more details, per Byron Murray: follow a small, but well-defined trail from the base of the Casual Route down through some talus, bending left to kind of a grassy ramp area.

From here, the first pitch of the Black Dagger will become evident as the shallow, left-facing corner.  P1. Climb up the steep dihedral until you reach a splitter hand crack (thin hands). The crack widens to 4\" for a series of exhilarating moves then returns to thin hands. 5.11a. 160 feet.  P2. Begin with steep finger jams. After 30 feet, you will reach the base of the Black Dagger chimney (this is the obvious, dagger-shaped chimney visible from Chasm Lake - and I-25 for that matter). The crux is grunting your way through a squeeze / slot that leads from the splitter crack below to the elevator shaft / chimney above (5.11a). The 80-foot chimney is enjoyable 5.7 when dry, but reputed to be wet at times. Belay at the top of the chimney below a large, ominous roof.  P3. Begin by exiting the Black Dagger chimney via the looming roof overhead. Stem your way to the edge of the roof (you will need double-long runners on any protection below the roof). Pull the roof and kick your feet out onto the face - very exciting! Above the roof, you will want a directional as the rope easily becomes stuck in the roof. There are two options from here - straight up is 5.11a OW with a bolt. Otherwise, traverse right about six feet and follow an incipient hand crack for 80 feet.

       " \"An incredible climb at high altitude on the most famous wall in Colorado. This is the easiest route on the Diamond, but that doesn't mean it's not world class. The route includes incredible climbing with awesome exposure and high alpine weather. Although I have heard the route described as both stiff, and easy for the grade, I think that the published ratings are quite accurate.  P1: Start in the middle of the wall at a less than vertical broken pillar. It is not hard to find. Pitch 1 is 5.4 up broken ground to the bottom of an obvious crack.  P2: Follow the steeper crack at 5.9 to a hanging belay 2/3 of the way up.  P3:  A 100 foot 5.7 traverse with about three pieces of pro, two of which are fixed pins. This pitch is spectacular and has dangerous fall potential, although the climbing is easy.  P4: Climb up a dirty 5.8 crack and chimney to a belay about half way up the route.  P5: May be the best pitch of the climb. It leads up a steep 5.8 dihedral with a handcrack tucked in the corner. Belay halfway up the dihedral on a stance and continue up 5.8 to the Yellow Wall Bivy Ledge. The exposure hits you right here for the final, and crux, pitch.  P6: Climb up a really thin 5.9 crack with fixed gear to a 5.8 squeeze chimney. Trying to squirm your way up the chimney at 14,000 feet is about as strenuous as it gets. From here pull out of the chimney and perform the crux move, a well protected reach over a bulge on thin holds, 5.10a, and you're on Table Ledge.  P7: One last 5.7 traverse pitch leads to the exit onto Kiener's or the rap route.\",\n",

       " 'D1 is the quintessential Diamond climb.  Sustained and pumpy, some funky rock, great exposure, classic history- simply a great place to be.  The first route climbed on the Diamond, it was freed in the late \\'70s via a horrendous, wet 5.11 chimney above Table Ledge that may still be unrepeated. The original aid line left of this was freed in the early \\'80s, and provides a difficult and exciting finale.  The route is obvious, taking the center plumb-line crack system to the apex of The Diamond.    The first 200-300 feet is moderate climbing (5.8-5.9), lower-angle (at least compared to above) and a bit broken.  If you have a pack, it may be efficient to have the second carry the pack instead of hauling.  It is also time-saving to simul-climb the first 2+ pitches.  Stay a bit right on the \"D1 pillar\" and it is easy to avoid climbers on the Casual Route.  After this lower section, belay just below the obvious 5.10 overhang, on the higher of 2 stances.  Climb the overhang, and a stretch of 5.10 above; with long slings down low you can avoid rope drag higher on the pitch.  Near the top of the pitch skip the belay stance at the base of the overhanging handcrack (bail slings here) and continue up 20-25 feet to a small but comfortable belay ledge on the left with good anchors.  Now you can skip the cramped hanging stance (bail slings here) midway up the pumpy hand crack in the overhanging wall and go all the way to the bivy ledge in one long pitch.  Somebody should replace the bolts at the bivy ledge.  From here, one rotten 5.10c pitch gets you to Table Ledge, a cramped stance/alcove at this point.  Have a rain jacket handy, even if the weather is splitter, because drips from the ice plug can soak you at this belay.  At Table Ledge step left (or barge straight up the wet 5.11 offwidth) and tackle a pumpy boulder problem which leads to sustained 5.11 climbing.  This is a long pitch that is waaaay up there.  The final 5.8 pitch may feel like the crux...wet, icy at times, and runout.    Not everyone will agree with a 3-star rating, although some well-rounded Diamond climbers I know consider D1 the best Diamond climb.  It is not quite as sustained as King of Swords, but the crux pitch is probably harder than anything on the King, and the rock is better.  The crux pitch is among the best 5.12a Diamond pitches, along with the crux pitch on Ariana and the Gilbert dihedral variation to King of Swords.  Early season (June) D1 is often dry and climbable.',\n",
       " 'After the Casual Route and Pervertical Sanctuary, this is probably the most \"straight-forward\" Diamond Route, although the free climbing rating is rather stiff (5.11c or d).  The crux is short and protects well, and is easily aided.  Climbers who find the Casual Route jammed, and don\\'t have enough big gear for Pervertical, should consider attempting this at 5.9 or 5.10 C1 (or free), but plan on a longer day if you aid much (the entire climb is still strangely popular as a clean aid route). The climbing is generally clean and solid, with many relic fixed pins set as reminders that in its heyday, this was the most popular route on the Diamond (FA: Dalke, Goss, Hurley 1966 at 5.6 A2). D7 is also the unquestioned favorite for those few demented souls who climb the Diamond in winter.  The descriptions in Rossiter, Gillett, Wadman and Dumais are all accurate, but if you do not have access to these what follows is a brief narrative describing the route.    You have survived North Chimney.  Now locate the bivy cave up and left from the top of North Chimney and Casual Route. Traverse left and low (below the loose ledge leading to Yellow Wall start) to an exposed, 4th Class or lower 5th Class step which leads to the second prominent left-facing corner system from the cave (the first being the 5.11 start to Yellow Wall).  Climb several pitches of finger and handcrack (5.9) in corners and around small flakes to a short wide section of low-end 5.10 (a couple of pieces to 4\" useful here) to a good ledge and a fixed anchor. If aiding, this wide section may be the crux. Climb the right and smaller of 2 right-facing corners directly above to a continuous section of stiff 5.10 and belay.  The free climbing crux looms above, a bulging section of white rock with parallel finger cracks splitting it (a fairly obvious feature).  Launch upwards, then strut your stuff on the pumpy-to-protect 15 feet of technical pulls where the angle steepens- classic, clean, and exposed climbing.  Belay on a small ledge, then climb a short difficult section (5.11a) leading to easier climbing and \"Almost\" Table Ledge (rap anchors).  Climb the easier rock above to Table Ledge and traverse slightly left to anchors (start of the rappels, which are \"climbers left\" from the route) or further left to Kiener\\'s and the North Face Cables descent.  4 to 8 hours climbing time, although aid parties may take much longer- consider a bivy on Broadway.  There are several variations to this route (Soma and D Minor 7 are the major ones)and much opportunity for \"mixing and matching\" (it\\'s even possible to head into Hidden Diamond or Curving Vine at one point), but really, D7 takes on the most compelling and recommended line between Pervertical and Yellow Wall.',\n",

Gain the right-facing, left-leaning corner/ramp (easier climbing but a little awkward) and follow this to a 2-bolt anchor which is part of the rappel route (5.11a, 110 feet).  2) Climb the steep, right-facing corner above, which varies from hands to fingertips for about 90 feet, 5.11b.

       " 'This is a fantastic aid outing up the middle of the right side of the Diamond. This a real aid route on the highest alpine big wall in the Lower 48.  Do not treat it lightly.  The crux is getting all the gear to Broadway.  Hauling a haul bag up the North Chimney is NOT recommended because of all the dangerous loose rock.  With wall gear, it\\'s probably safer to approach via the Chasm View rappels.  After the initial pitches, the climbing is   thin and steep, but never too scary accept when the ubiquitous thundershowers roll in.  Keep in mind the sun leaves the face around noon, so be prepared for heavy weather. On our ascent in early August we experienced lightning, hail, snow, rain, cold temperatures and even a little sunshine.    We climbed the route clean accept for P6 where my partner used a couple KBs and LAs. The route has been done all clean since then and it is probably easier to climb it clean on a few RPs than to drag a hammer and pins up and down the Diamond.  The clean crux would involve making something stick in the Knifeblade slots, so bring some trickery.  Standard clean aid rack: hooks, cam hooks, 3 sets RPs and Offsets, 1 set Ball Nuts, 3 sets nuts, a few hexes or tricams, 2-3 sets TCUs, 2 sets Friends, 1 big   cam (#4 Camalot or #5 Friend).  Poop tube - please pack your nasties out!  Once on broadway begin right of the North Chimney on the right side of a large pillar known as the Green Pillar or Dunn-Westbay pillar.

Leave Broadway and climb up rampy terrain to a large right facing dihedral on the right side of the pillar. 5.8, 145 feet.    P2.  Free climb a nice hand crack in a slimy, cold corner to a good stance or throw in an aid move to get warmed up for the dangling and thrashing to come. This would be a fun pitch if it were dry and in Boulder Canyon, but it\\'s not.  5.9+.  P3  More free climbing or gear yarding in the corner.  The crack becomes wide at the top. Arrive at the top of Green Pillar.  Belay at a fixed anchor with a hangerless bolt.  Possible bivy.  5.10, P2 and P3 are about 165 feet of climbing. Also, with a 60m rope it might be possible to just combine P1, 2 and 3 and make the top of the pillar   in 2 long leads.  P4. Short pitch. Head off the right side of the bivy ledge on aid.  Make a hook move somewhere around here and don\\'t fall.  Then follow a flake (cams) back to the left and head into an awkward slot (big cam) and belay at some fixed slings although it is probably better to   continue and climb.  P5.  The remainder of the pitches and belays can be combined in different ways.  There are some fixed anchors from retreats, but nothing compelling enough to dictate the location of the belays.  It\\'s sling belays to the top either way. Do what feels   good and makes sense.  C3-, 95 feet.  P5. From here the route finding is easy, take the crack to the top. Isn\\'t the Diamond cool?  Head up the crack to a sling belay at some fixed gear. C2-, 145 feet. ??  P6.  This is the crux unless P4 was the crux.   Nonetheless, this is a brilliant pitch.  Get out the RPs and head up the thin splitter crack.  Belay at a stance well below Table Ledge crack.  C3 or C2+ (new wave) or A3 or whatever. \"It\\'s all A1 until you fall.\"  145 feet.  P7.  Make some moves off the belay on small nuts and continue to the roof.  Belay at the roof (fixed gear) or climb some of P8.  Table ledge crack forms the roof.  There is no Table Ledge here!  C2 100 feet??  P8.  Head out a few feet to the right from the belay and with big exposure climb through the roof.  After passing a detached flake, belay.  C2, 155 feet.  P9. Keep aiding towards the top and belay at the edge of the Diamond on a ledge. C1, 150 feet.  Stay roped up.  P10.  Another pitch is required to reach a good unroping point.

Belay on a natural anchor to the left in a small corner.   P5. Climb strait above the anchor until it's possible to head right into a flared crack system. A bit of a spicy section above the flared cracks leads to an incredible traverse left into the crux sequence (5.12b). It is pumpy climbing with no stopper moves, hang on for the ride!

       " \"This route should probably be added to the database for a variety of reasons.  First, the current description under the Yellow Wall omits the last pitch, which is probably the crux of the FF, and second, the Yellow Wall is not the FF, and vice versa, as much as we would like to say we've climbed the Yellow Wall of the Diamond when we climb this variation (see comments under Yellow Wall).   I suggest the Yellow Wall entry in the database be revised to describe the actual Yellow Wall climb and not just the easiest path up this part of the wall.  Pitches 4-6 of the Forrest Finish involve pretty burly and sustained hand/fist crack climbing.  There isn't any 5.10 offwidthing as stated in the Gillett guide, but it's still pretty darn physical.  It goes without saying that this type of crack climbing is pretty draining at 13,500+, and will probably feel more like 10+/11- if you're not well acclimitized (as is usually the case).  To start, climb the first 3 pitches of D7 or Yellow Wall to the right side of Crossover Ledge, each of which is 10-.  The D7 variation to FF (called Komito Freeway) is actually the path of the first free ascent of the DIamond by Goss & Logan, though they apparently switched over to Black Dagger in the middle of the 6th pitch.  P4- From the right side of Crossover Ledge (with the Black Dagger slot looming above), climb up about 20 feet until you can find a rightward traverse that leads over to the FF crack system (5.9).  Climb the crack system to an obvious intimidating flare/OW.  Climb the OW with the help of a crack on the left (5.10) and contnue until rope drag stops you in your tracks and belay (150 feet).    P5- Continue up the crack system through an OW (guide calls 10a but it felt more like 5.8/9).  Rest and then climb the burly, sustained hand/fist crack past some awkward pods (10) to belay alongside the Yellow Wall bivy ledge (100 feet).  P6- More wide hands (10) leads to a good rest with multiple options above.  The Black Dagger system is the leftmost and looks like it is probably the easier way to go.  The FF takes the right variation and climbs a funky, insecure lieback (10) up into a slot.  Awkwardly climb the slot via a mix of kneebars and face features in the slot (10) up to Almost Table Ledge (150 feet).  The FF continues up from here via 2 more seldom-climbed 5.9 pitches to the top of the Diamond.  The usual option is to traverse left to a short right-facing dihedral where a pin protects a 5.8 move up to Table Ledge.  Descend following the D7 rappel route (6 raps) to Broadway and then 4 raps to the side of the N. Chimney to the Mills Glacier.  The alternate option, which is probably faster, traverses over to Kiener's and follows that, skirting the summit, to the N. Face cables descent.  The disadvantage to the latter option is that you have to hike a grueling 400 vertical feet up Kiener's late in the day and that you can't stash your gear at the base of the wall.\",\n",
       " 'The Full Dunn-Westbay frees the original Dunn-Westbay aid line. Josh Wharton had freed about \\xc2\\xbd the route in 2011 at 13-, avoiding the 5.14 and 5.13- crux sections of the aid line by traversing over into Gear and Clothing. The original aid line follows one perfect crack line to the summit, and the Full Dunn-Westbay free climbs this system ledge-to-ledge in 4, 80m (80m rope required!!!) rope-stretching pitches.  It is the most continuous splitter route on the Diamond. No bolts were added for protection on any of the pitches. The immaculate rock, ample protection, sustained climbing, and spectacular position makes it truly one of the best multi-pitch climbs in Colorado. It is hard to believe things like this exist in the alpine.  Note: It is possible to split the crux pitch into 2 pitches by belaying (hanging) at the end of the 5.12 section on the crux pitch, it is unclear whether this changes the grade. Doing it as one mega-pitch certainly adds a mental crux. The proper route should be done ledge-to-ledge as Tommy Caldwell envisioned.',\n",

       " \"The Honeymoon is Over is one of, if not the, most difficult routes on the Diamond. Although the Full Dunn-Westbay is technically rated higher (14- vs. 13c), the Honeymoon packs more of a punch (4 5.13 pitches) than the Full DW (1 pitch of 5.14-). I found the Honeymoon to be a generally harder day out mentally and physically than the DW, but the crux pitch of the DW is harder than any one pitch of the Honeymoon. This comparison highlights the complexity of rating multi-pitch free climbs with a single number.  The Honeymoon was established by Eric Doub in the 1990s, who worked the route for a number of years. Eventually, Eric passed the route off to a young Tommy Caldwell who fired it, practically onsight, in the summer of 2001. Tommy went up one day in early summer to attempt it and managed to free-climb the route through the crux 13c pitch with 1 fall until being forced to retreat due to wet rock. He came back in August and fired the whole route with no more prep in between attempts. Tommy's effort on the Honeymoon is one of the most impressive alpine free climbing ascents to-date given the extremely technical and difficult nature of the climbing and his almost on-sight ground-up style.   I did not have such good style and opted to rappel in over a couple of weekends....  Pitch breakdown:  Approach pitches: climb the first 2-3 pitches of Eroica, depending on how you break it down, to the base of the 11c stem corner on Eroica.  Pitch 1 (11c): climb the technical 11c stem corner of Eroica, and belay at a hanging belay at two bolts where Eroica traverses left.  Pitch 2 (13-): continue up the thin corner to a bolt below a small roof/overlap. Traverse right under the roof to a crack out left, and then punch it over the roof to a fixed hanging belay at 4 fixed stoppers (green Camalot backs up the belay).  Pitch 3 (13c): climb an ultra technical, thin RP seem with a 8 inch offset off the belay for 30 feet to easier climbing and some bolts. Follow the bolts to a small overlap and traverse right to a hand crack. Climb the handcrack up to a bolt out left on the face, and execute a difficult face boulder problem to a ledge stance.  Pitch 4 (13-): make difficult moves off the belay left to an undercling traverse, and follow this to a small corner. Climb the corner to a bolted overhanging boulder problem, followed by easier climbing to Table Ledge crack.  Pitch 5 (13-): traverse right to an obvious, hanging flake system with bolts. Lieback up the flake system past a couple of difficult sections to a bolted belay on a ledge.  Pitch 6 (12-): climb the dirty crack for ~130 feet to a small dihedral ~30 feet from the top of the wall. Execute a 12- boulder problem, clipping a fixed pin and a bolt, and then continue to the summit on easier climbing.\",\n",
       " 'The late, great Derek Hersey considered King of Swords one of his favorite rock climbs.  The climbing is unrelenting, overhanging, strenuous, and intimidating, yet it also is varied, aesthetic, interesting, and memorable.  It is one of only two free climbs on the right side of the Diamond (so far), the other being the much more difficult The Joker (which, incidentally, is named after Derek).    The tenor of free climbing on the right side of the Diamond is noticeably different than the left (i.e. Yellow Wall) side.  Rock quality in the middle stretches is often fair to poor at best, with a decomposing, rotten nature, although there is some very good rock higher.  The wall is much steeper than on the Yellow Wall, and hence the climbing tends to be very strenuous and taxing, and the \"feel\" intimidating and exposed.  There can also be considerable seeping from snow melt on the higher pitches.  From North Chimney head right on Broadway and locate the first crack system right of the first major pillar (i.e. the Green Pillar; the dihedral is the start of the Dunn-Westbay).  KoS is identified from below as the crack system which crosses the right side of the obvious \"S\" shaped roof a third of the way up (although the route starts in a system left of this).    P1: Climb this 5.9 crack for 125 feet to a sling belay.    P2: Continue up until the crack ends and traverse right (5.10-), then up and right to a belay on the right side of a ledge. There are 2 fixed pins at this belay- these are the last fixed anchors on the route. It would be very difficult to retreat from above this point since the route is so steep, and all anchors would be your own gear.    P3: Step right and climb \"The Torture Chamber\", a rotten, poorly-protected 5.11a slot (the worst rock on the route- it crumbles in your hands); or climb the original line (slightly harder though better-protected) moving out of the slot and onto the wall to the left.  Set up a hanging belay 10 feet below the S-shaped roof; have several pieces up to 2.5\" to make this anchor bombproof, and since it\\'s hanging consider a butt bag.  A lead of the Torture Chamber has been described as a \"Rites of Passage\" pitch.   P4: Now tackle the strenuous 5.11- fist crack above (liebacking may work also), moving out of the crack right, then back left, up corners, to below a clean right-facing corner.  There may be slight variations to do in this pitch.  Belay at the highest possible stance directly below an impressive, clean R-facing corner (the Gilbert variation) at some bomber gear (1.5F, 2.5 F, large stopper).   P5: Climb the crux corner (this is the Gilbert variation)- certainly 5.12a if you stay in it at the start, but you can climb a wee bit left for 20\\' before entering it.  At the top step left to the top of the column and belay.  Or, climb the original line, the left side of the column, at a slightly easier (5.11d) grade.  If this climbing were on Castle Rock, it would be more like 5.11c, but up there...The Gilbert variation is one of the top 3 classic \".12a\" pitches on the Diamond, the others being the crux leads of D1 and Ariana. It may be wet in places due to drips from above.   P6: Now proceed directly up the 5.11 thin hands crack above, through Table Ledge (an overhang here), up 30 more feet of .10d to an inobvious, wet .10 traverse left to a stance- another long pitch.     P7: Climb this crack to the top- wide, wet, and hard 5.10.  Luckily the gear is good on this pitch (some fixed pins, if you can find them under all the slime).     This is a great adventure climb, and folks with a better-than-average tolerance for poor rock could argue for a 3-star rating.  In 1995 this climb was linked with the Diagonal Super-Direct (V, 5.11d) on the Lower East Face in just under 11 hours.  ',\n",
       " 'This climb would probably be a four star if started via Pervertical, rather than Window Direct.  Once you get to the Obelisk, the climbing is three star, featuring cracks than are a little cleaner and steeper than usually found on the Diamond.  The route is in a south facing dihedral on the left edge of the Diamond.  The Obelisk itself starts about halfway between Broadway and Table Ledge.  There are two standard methods of getting from TL to the first pitch of the Obelisk: via Pervertical Sanctuary or the Window Direct.  Either of these approaches is problematic.    The PV approach climbs the first three pitches of PV (excellent climbing) then traverses left to the Obelisk dihedral.  The traverse, if done from the 3rd belay of PV is said to be hairy -- 5.11R. [Gillett] writes than he once did this traverse in the opposite direction and it was not bad; he believes he probably traversed lower than PV\\'s 3rd belay.  At any rate, this traverse is capable of gumming up the works.    The Window Direct approach, which we did, looks efficient on paper -- two pitches, 5.7 and 5.5.  The first pitch starts just right of a huge, right-facing corner at the top of the the menacing snow/ice field which obstructs Broadway below PV; add an extra pitch for dealing with this obstacle.  To avoid the snowfield, we traversed on the small ledge system that starts around Yellow Wall and parallels Broadway about 20\\' above it.  We followed this easy traverse for more than a rope length until we intercepted a [vertical] crack system w/ some fixed pins (about 30-50\\' right of the huge corner).  We belayed at the end of the traverse.  We climbed the crack system upwards and slightly left for about 100\\', belaying just below a long ledge system of black rock; this pitch featured supspect rock, intermittent pro and was harder than the 5.9 last pitch of PV.  The next pitch went up to the ledge system and traversed right for 200\\' w/ some up, down, left and right to the base of the Obelisk dihedral; though the climbing on this pitch might be 5.5 it includes bad rock, scant pro (including some Dolemite [style] fixed pins) and a culminating [vegetated], wet, protection-free slab with horrible rope drag.  These two pitches of WD rate a Bomb.  The Obelisk: P1 (5.11a, 100\\') This 3* pitch which utilizes cracks of the right wall and in the corner is strenuous but not too technical.  Extra hand size cams are useful.  Belay at a worthless 1/4\" bolt and a so-so ledge. If this pitch were more accessible, it might be considered the classic handcrack of the [Front Range].  P2 (5.10a, 30\\') Continue up the corner to a better ledge the base of the offwidth.  This pitch could sensibly be combined with the previous, gear permitting -- a second yellow Alien would help realize this linkup.  P3 (5.11a, 80\\')  A slightly overhanging 5-6\" crack in the corner which ends atop the pillar, at a good ledge shared with PV.  Gear: almost the entire pitch accepts #4.5 Camalots; a #4 Camalot would be next to useless, while a #5 would only be useful at the end.  Supplemental gear, ranging from small wires to hand-sized cams, is periodically available in a crack on the left, but placing this gear sometimes obstructs coveted hand holds. Kneepad recommended for left knee. All things considered, this is a very fun pitch; again, if this were at Lumpy or Vedawoo, it would be the classic of its type and grade.  Despite the guidebook ratings, I found this pitch considerably easier than Crack of Fear (\"10d\") at Lumpy.  P4 (5.9, 100\\') The last pitch of PV to Table ledge, belay about 40\\' south of rap anchors.  This pitch seems like a cakewalk after what preceded it -- if the weather is threatening, you can really motor here.  EXTRA BETA (onsighters stop reading):  P1: Climb the corner for about 10\\' then traverse into the crack; going straight up the crack is 5.12ish campusing on painful fingerlocks.  Extra beta: have a #0.75 Camalot on a quickdraw ready to plug at the end of the traverse.  After 30\\'-40\\' of solid (if strenuous) handjamming, the crack narrows down, seemingly to thumbstacks; at this point, despair mounts, until you realize it is possible to stem back into the corner and breath a sigh of relief, assuming you have any breath left.  P3: This is probably too obvious to be considered beta, but solid left side knee jams, sometimes with heel toe, can repeatedly be obtained.  The right inside wall of the crack contains many hidden edges, particularly higher up.  Getting started is kind of tough, but once you\\'re moving the crux is about 1/3 of the way up; at the end of this section there is a a decent foothold on the right face, from which you can rest or at least hang out until gasping subsides; from this point the climbing eases [slightly].',\n",
       " \"Pervertical is the second easiest climb on the Diamond, but don't let this fool you into thinking it is a cake walk.  This is a serious route that can give you trouble unless you are good at all sizes of crack climbing. There are a few loose pitches,  but the upper pitches are phenomenal and there is superb exposure. As with all the Diamond routes, it is wise to become familiar with the layout of the wall before attempting these routes (especially your descent route as the rappel anchors can be hard to find), or better yet go with someone who knows the area well.  Begin on the far left side of Broadway on the right side of the Obelisk column.   P1. Climb the left side of the Mitten formation.  A loose pitch with sparse pro. (8, 130 feet)   P2. Climb the crack above the Mitten flake and belay at a ledge on  the right. (9, 100 feet)   P3. Continue up the crack and left facing corner to a bolt (manky) and gain a ledge at the right side of the Obelisk. (9, 100 feet)   P4. Crux pitch. 11a handcrack (10c old-school) that will leave you gasping for air. (11a, 130 feet).   P5. Offwidth pitch.  This is a four inch offwidth that is sustained, but fun if you like wide cracks. Right facing corner on right side of Obelisk, belay on top of this pillar (10a, 80 feet)   P6. From the right side of the pillar take a steep crack to Table Ledge (9, 100 feet). (My experience says this pitch is longer, more like 150 feet.)   Traverse left to get to Kiener's or right to the rappel anchors. \",\n",
       " 'The Yellow Wall was the second route up the Diamond, completed by Layton Kor in 1962 at V 5.8 A4.  Much of the route later went free, most notably the first pitch dihedral by Roger Briggs in 1976, and then later the \"A4 Traverse\" by Charlie Fowler and Dan Stone in 1978.  This last effort marked the free climbing of the original line in its entirety at 5.11b R, although several variations allow the climb to go free at easier and/or safer grades [Editor\\'s Note: Credit goes out to Patrick Vernon and Bosier Parsons for their contributions to the Mountain Project database of the most common variation of the Yellow Wall and the A4 Traverse, respectively].  Find the start by following a narrow catwalk up and left from the Broadway bivy cave to the first, obvious, left-facing dihedral.  This corner has a few pins in it and appears quite thin from below.    P1: Hard moves right off the deck, climb the dihedral with imperfect but adequate gear until the corner disappears and turns into an intermittant hand and finger crack splitter.  Follow this to an obvious belay at 150\\' on some flakes.  5.11b.  Alternatively, beginning just right of the corner, follow a ramping system of flakes up and right, then back left, eventually rejoining the corner at about 75\\'.  This variation avoids the 5.11 at 5.7, but the climbing up the remainder of the original first pitch still checks in at 5.9.  P2: Continue up the steep crack system via very cool climbing and great rock.  The pitch climbs like a face climb but utilizes the crack for pro.  Also, much fixed pro on this pitch.  Belay on another flake/ledge.  5.9, 150\\'.  P3: Continue up the same system.  The climbing is very similar but a bit steeper.  High on the pitch there are several fixed pins and suddenly Crossover Ledge becomes apparent 10\\' to the left.  Clip a high pin and make a difficult move left to the ledge.  It may be possible to continue straight up the crack system, but Crossover Ledge makes a sensible belay.  5.10c, 150\\'.  P4: Above the ledge the crack system continues up and into Black Dagger.  Climb up off the right end of the ledge, and forego the Black Dagger by doing a wild, exposed traverse right.  Continue up and right to an obvious left-facing, right-leaning corner with a hand crack.  Up above this is the Forrest Finish (5.10c), a popular escape from/variation of the original Yellow Wall (climbing the Yellow Wall this way is known as the \"Briggs/Candelaria Variation\").  Belay about 15\\' below the A4 Traverse at a small stance; this stance is about 20\\' up the corner, and above the level of a few old rusty Leeper bolts that appear on the wall way off to the right.  5.9, 100\\', and a great pitch.  P5: The A4 Traverse.  In order to give credit to Bosier Parsons, I\\'m using his excellent description for this pitch, with some minor edits afterwards to serve as an update:  \"This is a description of the A4 Traverse pitch on the Yellow Wall. I decided to add it to encourage those who aspire to climbing it. The pitch is excellent in quality and does deserve the rating given, but it is definitely very doable, and not horribly dangerous. If you\\'ve been wanting to climb this pitch but have been afraid of the serious rating, get up there and do it! If you want to attempt the pitch with minimal beta and have more of an adventure experience, do not read on.  The belay at the end of the pitch off of Crossover Ledge can be made at the base of the first wide section on Forrest Finish, or, it is better to climb the right leaning, left-facing corner, via 5.9+ hands to a good but small ledge about 30 feet higher. This is in the middle of the left facing dihedral that begins the A4 Traverse pitch.  From the higher belay, continue up the corner about 15-20 more feet via 5.9+ or 5.10- liebacking. At the nest of webbing with a couple pitons, hand traverse right for a couple moves, then mantle up onto the thin ledge. Once on the ledge, you will find a good piton, then a rurp with a very old piece of webbing. Continue traversing the ledge about 15 more feet to a fixed bashie, just below the crux move. This traverse ledge is very small and thin, but pretty easy to walk across. The bashie protects the crux move and is bomber. Believe me, I tested it with about a 20 footer (with rope stretch). The crux move takes you up into a shallow, left-facing corner, that involves strenuous liebacking with small footholds. This section is protected by one 5/8\" angle driven about 1/2 way (but seemed decent enough), and then at the top by a fixed wire. I thought this corner seemed like sustained 5.10+ climbing for about 20-25 feet. At the top of this corner, pull up onto another ledge, and traverse right and up past some more fixed pins to a steep left-facing corner. Climb this corner for about 40 more feet of 5.10 with gear from 1/2\" to 3\". I placed my #3 Camalot for the exit move from this corner onto the large ledge where the route joins the Casual Route (still 40 feet below Yellow Wall Bivvy Ledge), but I\\'m sure many climbers would not need this piece of gear on this pitch. Belay here or continue up easily to YWBL (190\\').\"  Updates as of August, 2007:  The nest of webbing at the top of the first corner is no longer there.  The pin at the start of the traverse can be backed up with a small cam placed a few feet above it.  The webbing on the RURP looks really bad, as does the copperhead, but a fall from the crux move would probably be safe, albeit terrifying, even if they both blew.  The pin in the second corner (above the bashie), seemed decent and it can be backed up with RPs and a 00 TCU, but the fixed wire at the top of this corner is no longer there.  I thought this pitch had excellent climbing and was well worth doing, although the fixed pro is pretty suspect.  If the gear held, as it did for Bosier, a fall would be no big deal at all.    5.11a, 190\\'.  P6: The Casual Route\\'s crux pitch.  Continue up difficult finger cracks to a squeeze chimney to another difficult finger crack and belay on Table Ledge.  5.10a, 150\\'.  Evidently, most parties traverse off on Table Ledge at this point, but two more, seldom done and dirty/wet pitches continue upwards.  P7: Hand traverse 15\\' straight right on Table Ledge and then climb a wet, moss and mud choked crack system for 50\\' before traversing slightly left to a right-facing corner.  Folllow this up to the right end of the huge roof system above.  Belay at a stance.  5.10+, 120\\'.  P8:  Follow the right-facing corner above the roof via a wide crack up to the top of the wall.  Wet, 5.9, 150\\'.  Descend via the North Face/Cables or by reversing upper Kiener\\'s and doing the D7 raps.   ',\n",
       " \"This is an amazing area along the SW ridge of Long's Peak that connects with Pagoda Peak.  I've been told that prior to 1994, no one had climbed here.  It took a quick ascent up Pagoda's N Face & clear skies to inspire exploration here.  From Glacier Gorge, this area draws your eye as you droll & dream of a traverse along Chief's Head, Pagoda, Keyboard of the Winds, Long's Peak, & back down.  This area lies downhill from The Palisades.  There are towers named: The Dark Tower, Mr. Stubbs, Mrs. Stubbs, Jackpot Tower, Sievers' Tower.  2 towers to the left of The Dark Tower may have names.  Some routes here include: Stubbs Fight Back, 5.11a; Picking Plums, 5.10c.\",\n",
       " 'This route is reminiscent of the White Whale at Lumpy Ridge, but is a bit more serious at the top and longer overall.  The rock quality is excellent.  The route ascends the rounded arete and left-facing dihedral system up the center of farthest left tower of significance in the Keyboard of the Winds.  Let\\'s call it Tower One, which is maybe 500 feet right (SW) from the top of The Trough on the Keyhole Route.  The easy going ends at overlapping rock near the top.  Move left into a left-facing corner system and climb it straight to the summit.  This can be avoided by traversing around to the left, but then you miss the spectacular summit.  Approach via Black Lake and the trail that continues to the broad shelf beneath Spearhead.  Hike to a point just east of Spearhead then head east and scramble up the low rib just south of the lower section of The Trough.  Work around the right or left side of a prominent spire low on the arete of Tower One and gain the crest of the ridge.  To descend from the summit, down-climb to a notch on the Longs Peak side of the tower.  Unfortunately the easiest return to Black Lake is to go back whence you came.  From the notch, scramble around to the southwest side of the tower and descend the gully (Tower Gully) between Tower One and Tower Two.  Another option is to traverse several hundred feet east and climb to the Narrows of The Keyhole route (Class 4) and descend The Trough all the way to trail above Black Lake.  It is NOT easier to descend behind the Keyboard towers to the col at the east ridge of Pagoda, though it may seem a good idea in theory.  The west side of the Dark Tower forms a steep cliff band that continues without interruption into the cirque of Keplinger\\'s Couloir.  An old iron piton (stamped \"MADE IN AUSTRIA\") indicates a previous rappel of the cliff.  I down-climbed the cliff in approach shoes, though this is not recommended.',\n",
       " 'This route ascends the NW arete or ridge of the unknown tower between Tower One and The Dark Tower.  Approach from Glacier Gorge as for Tower One and break right once even with the base of the buttress. A clean, right-facing dihedral is obvious on the right and is the crux of the route.  The climb over-all is reminiscent of the Keyhole Ridge on Long\\'s Peak, though the dihedral is somewhat more difficult.  Above the dihedral a short steep pitch leads to the crest of the ridge. Follow the ridge crest south to the summit.  Pretty good outing, but way remote.    The west side of the tower is another story.  Two long dihedrals face each other to create a narrow inset that tops out at the crest of the ridge. The left-facing corner on the right of the inset looks to be worth the long approach.  Another similar inset splits the face to the right.  Recommendation:  bring a rope and a partner.  To escape  from the summit, ooze down a slot then traverse a narrow ledge southeast to the notch between the summit and two big \"rabit ears\" spires. Return to Black Lake as for Tower One.',\n",
       " \"The Southwest Ridge of Long's features great rock and amazing views of Glacier Gorge. Yet, due to its shady ways , it can be a bit nippy in the morning.  While I'm not sure I'd hike all the way up there to do this route by itself, it is a good route to link with perhaps the Beaver 5.5 and/or Keyhole Ridge 5.6, etc.  Southwest Ridge is actually the continuation of Keyboard of the Winds to the summit of Longs. Choose your approach and shoe-up at the end(top) of Keyboard of the Winds. There are a few variations at the start but once 100 or 200ft up climb flakes and cracks straight up the prow. four pitches??

       " \"This is the wide band of less-than-vertical rock which guards the upper faces (including the Diamond) of the E face of Long's Peak.  Once this was a site of great adventures for the area.  Now, it seems it is often relegated to consolation routes or approach pitches during warm weather.  In a wet fall/winter, this area can sport some of the more impressive ice/mixed routes in the Front Range.  Some parts of this section of Long's is subject to objective hazards like rock or ice fall.  Also, due to the easterly aspect, this area is often in the shade by 1pm in the summer.  In winter, only the upper and northern parts get any sun.  Some of the more impressive/popular routes here include: Alexander's Chimney, 5.5 or better M4; Kor's Dor, 5.9; Malander's Passage, 5.8+; Stettner's Ledges, 5.7++; Smear of Fear, M6; Diagonal Direct, 5.11c; The Diagonal, 5.11b AO; The Directagonal, 5.11b; Field's Chimney 5.7 or M7; Wrecking Ball, M6; Slippery People, M6+; Morning Dew, M7; & Crazy Train, M6.You can use the 4 Crack of Delight rappels for routes on the right side of the Lower East Face.  Note, that Crack of Delight rappels is South of the North Chimney. See photo. For more details, per Byron Murray: follow a small, but well-defined trail from the base of the Casual Route down through some talus, bending left to kind of a grassy ramp area.  The trail terminates, and there may be a couple 4th class moves down a slot to a ledge.  Bolts/chains on your left, maybe chest high.  1 short rap (single rope) to a huge ledge.  3 double rope raps from there, last one puts you halfway down the snowfield.  For routes on the left side of the Lower East Face, per Aaron Martinuzzi: Alexander's Chimney can be rappeled with a single 70m rope in 4 raps. I posted this on the page for Kor's Door, but am duplicating it here in the event someone's looking for recent rap beta.   Rap 1: From just below Broadway (2 pin, 1 nut anchor with slings) rappel 100ish feet to a slung horn/nut anchor.  Rap 2: Another 100+ feet from the large horn down the face, past a station, and behind a large, slung chockstone to a ledge.  Rap 3: From a small slung chockstone/nut anchor at the ledge, rappel over the edge and down the chimney. At a stance about ~118 feet down, carefully slide off the end your ropes (!!!) and clip some tat on a piton/I-beam-shaped-chock anchor on the north (climber's right) wall.  Rap 4: Keep rappelling down the chimney another 115 feet to ledge-y terrain. Stop near the end of the rope, clipping into a down-ward driven pin in a ledge at head height to pull and coil up your rope.   From here, descend right (north) down 4th class ledges, encountering a couple 5.0-5.2 steps along the way back to the bottom of Lamb's Slide. This line of descent climbs right below the Door, and so is a reasonable descent for those leaving gear at the bottom of the climb. These rappels could be completed easily with double 50s or 60s, and could be managed with a single 60m rope - there are many intermediate stations and fixed pins (keep your eyes open) along the chimney that could be utilized for making 100' rappels. If rappelling with one 60, bring some extra slings, rap rings, and maybe extra nuts to beef up some of manky stations along the chimney.   This rappel route is ideal for parties who a) don't want to haul a 2nd rope b) don't want to traverse Broadway to the Crack of Delight c) don't care to summit or d) choose to leave gear at the base of the Lower East Face. Be warned, though, the Chimney is very wet, and your rope will probably be sopping (mine was) no matter how hard you try to keep it out of the small waterfall. \",\n",
       " 'This climb is not on the Diamond, but is on the Lower East Wall in between Stettner\\'s Ledges and the Lamb\\'s Slide.  I believe it\\'s most frequently climbed as an ice climb.  However, due to the lack of beta that I could find on this route, I don\\'t think it\\'s climbed too often in any season anymore.  We climbed it along with Upper Kiener\\'s and this is definitely recommended, hence the Grade III rating.  Other possible options are descending the Lamb\\'s Slide, or rapping the Crack of Delight or North Chimney.  This is an extremely committing climb, a lot of the rock is wet and makes the 5.5 feel like 5.8, especially if you are climbing in boots.  It took us 18 hours to car to car.    Approach: From the Long\\'s Peak Trailhead hike to Chasm Lake, skirt the lake on the north side and make your way up and to the left to the base of the Lamb\\'s Slide.  To get to the base of the chimney you can ascend Lamb\\'s Slide for about 300 feet and traverse right onto the broken rock band directly to the base of the chimney.  You can also climb to the base of the rock band to minimize the amount of snow encountered.This snow band is about 100 feet high and 30 degrees, it was bulletproof ice when we climbed it.  I took a nice 20 foot slide on it.  Bring at least one pair of crampons and ice axe for your team.  Lead up the snow and ice, trail a rope and pull the rest of your team up.  It took 4 of us 3 hours to negotiate this slope without crampons or ice axe.  Scramble up the broken rock band on 4th class rock, pick the line of least resistance and go as high as possible until you are on the highest ledge near the base of the chimney.  There is a good belay here.  The climb (our way):  Pitch 1: 40 feet, 5.0 or 5.6:  Climb up the wet chimney, 5.0,  or try to find a 5.6 crack to the right.  We climbed a small 5.6 crack with no feet, just to the right of the chimney and belayed about 40 feet up at some fixed gear on the right side of the chimney as we weren\\'t sure where the route went from here.    Pitch 2: 120 feet, wet 5.5:  In the chimney there are two left facing dihedrals, maybe one of these is 5.6 variation that Roach describes; however, they didn\\'t look too promising for climbing in boots, low angled and slabby.  We opted to climb directly up the wet chimney.  Use stemming technique to get up this chimney, when the wall gets really steep and wet look back for footholds on the sides of the wall.  Tricky, wet, freaky climbing for sure.  5.5 in the chimney sounds about right but it felt much harder.  Climb up until you are about 20 feet below a HUGE chockstone and belay here.  Pitch 3:  150 feet, 4th class:  \"Alexander\\'s Traverse\" Do an ascending 4th class traverse on a good ledge.  Protect the second on this traverse as a stumble would be difficult to recover from.  Climb for about 150 feet until the ledge ends beneath the \"Dog Ear Flakes\" and you are below obvious left facing dihedrals.  Belay here.  Pitch 4:  200 feet, 5.5:  Climb whichever dihedral looks best to you, in retrospect the best dihedral is probably the furthest left.  Go up a dihedral for 40 feet, 5.5, then traverse left into the Yellow Bowl.  Do not go too high on this pitch, if you can go left go left not up!!  We ran out the full 60m of rope on this pitch.  Establish a belay in the Yellow Bowl  Without a 60m rope you could break this up into two pitches, the dihedral and then the traverse.  Pitch 5:  80 feet, 5.4:  Climb the far left hand side of the Yellow Bowl up to the Broadway Ledge.  This was a fun pitch.    Here the route joins the Kiener\\'s Route.  Some quick details.  Traverse across Broadway Ledge to the base of Notch, climb up about 30 feet then get on the rock and climb Kiener\\'s chimney.  Make a quick turn to the right up a narrow slot, traverse north along some ledges, and angle up and to the left on the path of least resistance.  We simul-climbed most of this section, establishing a quick belay here or there for some tricky sections of 5.4.  Ascend the Devil\\'s Staircase up about 700 feet, make a 4th class step around the Diamond face.  There is a little bit of exposure here, around 2000 feet.  If the weather is holding scramble 200 feet to the summit; else, descend the Cable Route.  One double rope or two single rope raps off the old eye bolts  escape the difficulties.  Hike to the Boulderfield and take the Keyhole Route back to the trailhead.  What a committing climb, a full day of old school mountaineering.  I\\'m not sure I would do it again, but it was certainly worth doing once.  If not only to imagine what it must have been like up there in 1922 on the first ascent.  Do not leave the moxie at home.  The mixed/ice climb and its associated photos are here.',\n",
       " \"The Crack of Delight is located just to the left of the North Chimney on the East face of Longs Peak.  Though it has some wet spots and moss in the cracks, overall it is a good climb that throws a variety of situations at the climber.  Since it is the rappel route form Broadway, be careful of others throwing ropes and the occasional rock down the route.  It is sustained for its grade.  Pitch 1 - Locate a right facing corner immediately to the left of the North Chimney.  Climb the corner as it changes from right to left facing and belay at a two bolt belay to the left of the wide crack. 5.7 150 feet  Pitch 2 - More of the same.  Continue up the left facing corner until it turns back into a larger right facing corner.  Move up and to the left out of the corner system and into a chimney on the left.  Belay at a two bolt belay.  5.7 180 feet  Pitch 3 - Continue up the chimney system and climb above it to another two bolt belay.  5.7 190 feet  Pitch 4 - A move through a wide crack to the left of the belay leads to an easy scramble up to Broadway.  Belay at a two bolt belay.  This is the top station for the rappel route.  5.3 100 feet  Note that Rossiter's guide gives this route 5 pitches, with a 5.7 variation on the last pitch.  The route can be comfortably done if 4 pitches with a 200 foot rope.  Enjoy.  \",\n",
       " 'In 1959, with the Diamond closed to all climbing for safety reasons, the Lower East Face of Longs Peak was the \"next best thing\" for the hungry Boulder climbing community to focus on.  After considerable effort over that summer, Ray Northcutt and Layton Kor established \"The Diagonal\" route at V 5.9 A3.  Not only was The Diagonal the first Grade V rock climb in Colorado, it was a watershed event in Colorado climbing history, and led directly to the lifting of the climbing ban on the Diamond.  (The following summer, Californians Bob Kamps and Dave Rearick succeeded on the central plumb-line crack system on the Diamond, and fittingly named their route \"Diamond One\", or D1 as it is now called.  Ironically, Kor, who wanted badly to make the first ascent of the Diamond, was off climbing in Yosemite Valley at the time.)  Although aid was used by Northcutt and Kor on the Diagonal, according to Fricke\\'s 1971 RMNP guidebook the route developed a reputation for difficult and sustained freeclimbing, and was thus unpopular.    By the early 1970s the climbing paradigm had shifted to freeclimbing the remaining aid routes, and as one of the best \"lines\" in the RMNP The Diagonal came back into the spotlight.  The result was \"The Directagonal\", a challenging free variation to The Diagonal which follows the general line and creatively bypasses the rappel done by Northcutt and Kor on the first ascent.  The Directagonal crystalizes all the elements of \"adventure rock climbing\" into one memorable sojourn: excellent climbing (though often wet at the crux), inobvious route finding, some fractured flakes, vegetation in the cracks, runouts, nice exposure, a complicated descent...all above 13,000\\' and in one of the most dramatic alpine locales in the lower 48.  A spectacular route!    The route follows to half-height the obvious left-angling diagonal crack system that defines the central section of the Lower East Face, then traverses right into a large left-facing corner system which leads to Broadway.    P1: Begin at the base of the diagonal crack, and climb a short, cold, harsh 15 feet of 5.10d.  Continue to the higher of two small ledges on the left and belay (2 old bolts that need to be replaced).    P2: Step back right into the crack system and scrape upwards on (usually) wet rock past a difficult section (5.11a, adequate pro), then easier rock to an alcove below large overhangs.    P3: Climb through the overhang at 5.9+ or so, then after 30 feet hand traverses right at a large flake system (really fun) to a cramped belay stance at a right-facing corner system.    P4: This is perhaps the routefinding crux. Climb directly above the belay (in and just right of the corner) for a short way, then move up and right to a traverse at a bulge/overhang.  The traverse is 5.9, often a little wet, and does not protect well at all.  Now climb a crack system to a nice stance (this stance is where the Northcutt/Kor rappel ended).  A long pitch.  P5: Climb a short step to a single bolt, then move right to a tight left-facing corner (crux, excellent pro, often wet) that leads to the perrenially wet left-facing corner (5.10d, hand-size cams).  Belay on a small stance on the left.  Watch your ropes hanging from this belay, as there is a rope-eating loose flake 30 feet below.    P6: Now tackle the \"old school 5.9\" corner and flake system above, stepping right at the top to belay on the slopes of Broadway.    To exit, traverse right on Broadway (often snow and ice, loose rock) to the rappel line down Crack of Delight, or follow the lead of Roger Briggs and Australian Kim Carrigan and continue with the complete Yellow Wall (1980, all free, 14 hours).  I would wear a helmet on the Directagonal, since a lot of rocks come whizzing by from above (consider avoiding this and all Lower East Face routes on high season weekends since there is so much traffic directly above).  Although a Grade IV, it may take a full day for some parties.  Some sections of this route (the 5.9 traverse in particular) have mandatory free climbing that could not be aided in a rain storm.  There are (as of August 2000) slings at all belay stances, and it would be possible to rappel from most anywhere on the route, though above pitch 4 this may be problematic.  The 5.10d corner above the crux is almost always wet, and in wet years the 5.11 corner (and much of the route) will be a challenge to free climb.  Probably best as a late season climb when things may be at their driest.  Early season (June to mid-July) there may be more seepage, but, really, the plumbing on the East Cirque of Longs is a mystery.',\n",
       " 'P1 Start from Mills Glacier in a series of right-facing corners, below the left end of the big wet arches.  Move up and left to a splitter crack up the center of a small pinnacle.  Belay at a small stance at its top.  A bolt would be nice here. 5.10-.  P2 Follow the obvious seams up and right.  Fixed copperheads, pins, and a few bolts mark the way.  2-bolt belay. 5.11b.  P3 Traverse right, then up, then right, then up, aiming for small corners.  Some wet streaks will be crossed.  End with a wet corner to a 2-bolt belay.  5.10.  P4 Follow the easiest line, mostly straight up, to a large area of 2nd class ledges.  Belay below the left facing system of corners above.  5.8 - 5.9.  P5 Move up the left facing corners past several fixed pins to a 2-bolt belay. 5.11b (R).  P6 Go straight up, passing the cool crescent arch, to a 2-bolt belay.  5.11b.  P7 One green Camalot is the largest piece you need (or can place) on this pitch.  Climb up past an old bolt then move left with gear under the overlap flakes.  The technical crux is here, moving up and left to a good crack (5.12-).  Follow the crack until it ends (5.9) then pass two bolts (5.11).   Run it out to a fixed Alien (5.11c), then move right.  Run it out (5.11a) to a nice crack that ends on Broadway with a 2-bolt belay.  Descend from these anchors with 3 raps to the big ledges.  Then scramble  (belay suggested) 100 feet down and north to 2-bolt anchor, then do 3 more raps to Mills Glacier.  It\\xc2\\x92s very easy to descend from any of the last three pitches of the climb because the belay bolts are also the rap anchors.',\n",
       " \"For those interested in superlatives, this route offered several: loosest, wettest, widest, dirtiest... just about any negative adjective can be applied in spades.  We pegged it as a more direct line than the North Chimney to our objective on the Diamond, Pervertical Sanctuary.  This was true, although the disadvantages were many and serious.  Mostly, Fields' Chimney serves as a catchbasin for the entire left half of the Diamond, placing us in the line of fire for objects launched from acres of vertical granite by other climbers or random acts of gravity.  This we failed to realize at first, preoccupied as we were by wet rock, the fine coating of dirt left by snowmelt, the several horrors of rust-stained bail tat, and the creaking iron protruding from the loose, wet, and overhanging crux.  By the time we realized our error, we were already committed to topping out via roller-bearing slabs devoid of cracks and covered in dirt, fervently hoping that out predawn approach choice had safely placed us ahead of anyone else traversing Broadway above.  Strange that the worst route of my life was immediately followed by one of the best.  Get off your computer now, and go climb Pervertical.  Just get there some other way.\",\n",
       " \"Kor's Door climbs the clean buttress just left of Stettner's Ledges in 3-5 pitches of exquisite crack climbing on perfect alpine rock.  This is a great route at the 5.9 grade, well-protected, secure, and interesting.  The rock quality is flawless from bottom to top.  From the broad basin at Mill's Glacier head to the broken Class 4 ledge systems right of Lamb's Slide.  Wear a helmet, and if crossing below The Notch area move quickly since rocks come whizzing by here all the time.  You will most likely have to cross some snow and/or ice to reach the toe of the buttress.  Once on the broken buttress you are shielded from rock fall.  Scramble up the buttress to a perfect grassy ledge below the obvious rectangular inset with a large flake poised at it's lower left.  The perfect diagonal crack to your right is Malander's Passage.  Pitch 1: Move up and right, heading for the crack and corner system on the right side of the inset.  You will pass the large detached flake on your left.  Climb through a small roof at a handcrack (5.9-) and belay 30 or so feet higher at a small stance.  Pitch 2: Continue up the crack past several fixed pins through a second small roof.  Optional belay on the left.  With a 60m rope you can continue up and right into a thin right-facing corner to a ledge and belay.  You can even move to a higher ledge, and the end of the steep climbing, in a single 60m pitch.  Pitch 3: Many ways to exit.  Move into the large right-facing corners on the right (you are now on Stettner's) and continue to Broadway with a bit of simul-climbing.  Head right on Broadway and cross below the Notch to hit Kiener's and the route to the summit.  If you don't want to go up and over Long's you will need 2 ropes to rap Crack of Delight below the Diamond.  There may be rap anchors in Alexander's Chimney. Or make a day of it and tag the summit, then descend the North Face.   If you want to avoid the simul-climbing and climb shorter pitches, no problem, there are plenty of places to stop and belay.  This would result in about 5 pitches of climbing to reach Broadway.  One strategy for this climb is to go light, one rope, a light rack, and each climber carry a light pack.  Once on Broadway, put on your approach shoes and pack away the gear (although you may want to keep the rope out for the first 150 feet of Kiener's) and shoot for the top.\",\n",
       " \"This is a good alternative to Kor's Door or Stettner's Ledges if these routes are occupied. We did this following Kor's and a quick rap descent down Alexander's Chimney (see the Alexander's description for rap info). This would be a 3-star route if the third pitch wasn't junky. The first 2 pitches follow asthetic and continuous crack and face climbing on beautiful polished golden granite.  P1. About 30 feet down and to the right of the start of Kor's Door, look for a narrow ledge running to the right that peters out after about 30 feet and about 6 feet left of a shallow left facing dihedral crack. Traverse across the ledge and where it ends, drop down onto your hands and face climb right to the base of the dihedral -- 5.8+. This section is sporty with questionable pro and grim fall potential. Be solid at this grade. Climb the dihedral/crack and where it peters out, traverse right on face past an ancient quarter-inch bolt to another thin crack. Ascend the crack for 100 feet (5.8) with occasional forays onto face to the right. Eventually face climb slightly left of the crack to a small stance and belay.  P2. Continue up the crack system for 100 feet or more of superb finger locks (5.8). When the crack turns to 2.5 inch hand size, climb about another 40-50 feet to a good belay ledge at the base of a dirty right facing dihedral.  P3. Climb the dihedral (fixed pin) and continue up a series of dihedrals, flakes and cracks that generally trend to the left. After about 150 feet start to look for an unobvious traverse to the left to a long ledge system. Find a belay (we ran out all the rope). This is the ledge system that allows an easy traverse to the left (East) to the rappels of Alexander's. The best landmark for the start of this ledge is a stack of blocks pasted to the face. The alternative is to continue up Kor's or Stettner's to Broadway.  From the horror stories you read about the Broadway and Lamb's Slide descents, I would highly recommend the Alexander's rappels which were convenient and quick but very wet.\",\n",

       " \"This fun route is amazing from a historical perspective.  It was climbed back in the days of primitive climbing equipment by a pair of visionary brothers.  Its difficulty was certainly near cutting-edge for the day.  Today, it has been reduced to a moderate outing with the advent of modern equipment & technique.  Nonetheless, it has become a classic, mountaineering-style climb for RMNP.  It can be linked with the Window Route or Kiener's Route for a full day's mountaineering outing, weather permitting.  Route finding skills are a requirement, since there are many subtle variations to decipher with plenty of hardware and slings to obfuscate the original line.  Any topo for the route would be difficult to follow precisely. S. Kimball's topo (p. 140 of Lumpy Ridge, Estes Park Rock Climbs) may be the most accurate with all the extra squiggles.  He noted that the legendary Fritz Wiessner could not find the route when he tried to repeat it.  Loose rock is certainly part of the experience for this climb, so those in search of ultra-clean granite should seek other climbs.  Also, note much of the line remains in the shadows (facing North), so bring warm clothes (2 layers recommended, hat for the less-insulated).  It has been written up in Rock&Ice; under classic routes.  Perhaps, those who have climbed this route may feel that a different line is the 'original line' than the one described here.  Nonetheless, here is one variation that does work.  Warning: the following may be soporific.  Find this climb on the left side of the lower East face of Long's Peak about 5 miles in & 3000 feet up (2.5-3 hours for most).  Enter RMNP at the trailhead for the Long's Area off CO Hwy 7, just South of Estes Park, North of the Wild Basin entrance.  Hike up the trail for Keyhole (standard hiking) approach to the Chasm Lake cutoff, continue past Chasm Lake (skirting the North side), approach the firm snow of Mill's Glacier.  Kick steps to the rock.  If you get soft snow, have good enough footwear, have crampons, or have an ice axe, you may just continue directly up to the start at the highest tongue of snow right of Lamb's Slide.  You can skip the ice axe, crampons, and take the shortest bit of lowest angle snow to the left of the start to the rock, traverse up the moat to as far as you can go in tennies.  Then you can add a short 5.7-5.8s mostly traversing pitch up to a red sling & then traverse right.  This line of right-facing dihedrals & flakes lies just left of the two dark, wet streaks that drain the Notch Couloir and form the wonderful line, Smear of Fear.    Find a 2 pin belay stance a short distance above the snow.  P1.  Head up & gently left, choosing a line among the many cracks/flakes with loose rock in spots.  A few scattered pins may help to direct you but beware, they are not always leading you to the promised land.  At approximately 60 feet up, there is a large flake to the right with nice footholds to lieback, do not go this way or you will be forced to take a 5.8+ downclimbing traverse left to regain the line.  Continue to angle left.  ~130-140 feet up you may find an old pin at a ledge to belay.  However, there are many options for a belay.  P2.  Continue up moderate ground (5.4 or 5.5) with at least 4 pins to reassure you that you are on route.  You can belay at a very comfortable ledge about 100 feet up with a right-facing large flake/dihedral (old chopped bolt & hangerless bolt on the left) or you can seek the historic alcove belay up & left with pins on its back wall.  P3.  Wander up moderate but loose terrain with a long horizontal crack for pro.  Find a series of 4-5 pins that mark the famous 'piton ladder' (sometimes wet) free-climbed by Paul Stettner in 1927.  These pins trend slightly left on somewhat-delicate face climbing.  Beware of rope drag here.  Above the last pin, you can traverse left around an ar\\xc3\\xaate (harder) or traverse a few feet right to a moderate series of flakes & cracks to the belay ledge on Lunch Ledge.  ~150 feet.  There is another variation to the right of the 'piton ladder' that looked wetter than the piton ladder.  P4.  Move the belay left on Lunch ledge to its far left end where the terrain goes up steeper dihedrals.  ~100 feet.  P5. You are about 400 feet from Broadway here.  You will be faced with a choice on this pitch to finish as the 'original line' traversed left partway up this pitch to the finish on Alexander's Chimney or to continue Hornsby Direct or variation up to Broadway.  Start up a line left of the larger, wet dihedral sporting a couple pins.  Well-worn edges suggest you move back right to the larger, wet-in-places,  right-facing, dihedral.  Alternatively, you can stay a dihedral to the left with somewhat harder entry moves.  Continue up.  Somewhere here (allegedly the Dog's Ear of Alexander's Chimney) you can traverse left to the Alexander's Chimney's leftward traverse.  It is less than obvious.  You can continue up a full ~195 feet to a ledge with less than optimal pro (fair #2 Camalot, iffy #3.5 Camalot, looped horn, & itty bitty wire) or find a better belay below.  P6.  From here, there seem to be at least 4 dihedrals to choose from.  The right most is wet, wider, and less appealing and the apparent original Hornsby Direct finish.  The next one L to the route sports some fixed pro & a sling.  The next dihedral to the left is small but clean (fun, 5.8).  The next one left is harder to see but also sports something fixed in it.  From below, it is not obvious which dihedral has the 'many pins' described by various guidebooks.  You can move about 60 feet up before you must choose.  We chose the small dihedral, two dihedrals left of the large, wet dihedral.  It is clean, fun, & dry.  From the marginal belay described on P5, it is a full ~195 feet to Broadway.  You top out just left of the exposed '5.1' move at Broadway.  Nice cracks above a boulder take fingers- to hand-sized pro.  Descent:  This can be potentially the crux.  1) you can ascend the Notch Couloir if you lugged up snow/ice gear.  2) You can ascend Kiener's (right on Broadway past the Notch Couloir) to the top of the Diamond, then down climb/scramble the North face of Long's to the Cable Route rappel.  3) You can traverse off left to Lamb's Slide and kick steps, self-arrest, or downclimb if you have the right equipment.  4) You can certainly rappel off the first 3 pitches worth on in situ rap anchors (best to have 2 ropes).  For any of the following descents, I recommend staying roped up to access the raps.  We did not see obvious established rap stations above P3 via Hornsby Direct.  5) You can rappel off the top of Alexander's Chimney (Direct) approximately 300 feet left of the Hornsby Direct finish at a pile of snow just below Broadway.  You start with a pin & nut rap above a boulder.  There are many variations to the rappels here.  2x60m ropes are recommended.  You can go about 100 feet to a large slung spike backed up with a nut.  It starts to get wet here.  You can rappel approximately 110 feet to below & right of the chockstone, very wet from here down.  You can rap approx 100 feet to another anchor (less recommended) or 190 feet to a double spike slung (back-up-able with a #2 Friend), right of the chimney.  You can reach the snow with another 190 feet rappel.  There were no other obvious established rap points here & down and the terrain is still steep & definitely loose.  You still must descend lower Lamb's Slide from here.  6) you can rap off the original finish on Alexander's Chimney route approximately 60 feet below Broadway & then into Alexander's Chimney (see 5) above).  2x60m ropes are recommended.    3 stars for fun, 2 for rock, 1.5 for abundant loose rock, 3 for history buffs, 2.5 for the setting, 2.4 overall.  It is best to climb this on a weekday.  Consider other routes if you are unfortunate enough to be climbing under other parties above on Kiener's or on Broadway above the route!\",\n",
       " \"This is an amalgamation of area between the Diamond/Chasm View Wall and the West Face of Long's Peak.  The climbs in this area are probably more mountaineering in nature than much of the rest of the climbs on Long's Peak.  Historically, this aspect of the peak is important as it was once equipped with cables to facilitate non-climber's ascent of the peak.  Since, these cables have been removed, and this face has much reduced traffic.  It is often used for the descent of routes off the top of the Diamond.  Routes along here include: The Cable Route, 5.4 or M2; Keyhole Ridge, 5.4; The Keyhole, 3rd class.\",\n",
       " \"First of all, so there's no confusion, this route is NOT on the diamond.  It is just filed under that rock. I give this route one star, but not because it is a bad route.  It is an excellent first technical alpine route for a beginner.  After doing the route, however, I would probably not be interested in doing it again unless it was a winter ascent, which would be different.  The history of the route is kinda interesting.  I'm not sure of specific dates, but in the early part of the 1900's a thick steel cable was bolted to the rock with huge eye bolts (much like the bolts on the 3rd).  Non-technical climbers would use this as an aid to climb up this face of Longs.  That is until people started to realize that a 1in. thick cable bolted to the rock for hundreds of feet is a great conductor of electricity.  The cable was removed, but a couple of the eye bolts still exist at the belays.  This climb is best started from the boulder field at the base of Long's approaching from the East.  From the boulder field, the hike is only about 0.25mi. to  the start of the climb and about 1.5mi. descent from the backside (W. side) of Long's.  Otherwise, you're looking at a 6 mi. hike just to the boulder field with a full  pack of gear.  Best climbed mid summer through early fall (unless you bring crampons).  I climbed it mid-October in 1998 and it was cold and coated with a nice layer of verglass (thin ice).  This changed the grade from easy 5.4 to very contemplative 5.6-7ish.  There is only really one full pitch of technical climbing, then it's very easy 5th and 4th class for a pitch or so.  After this, 3rd class get you to the summit, taking the line toward the edge of the diamond, then back to the summit.  The ranger station at the Longs trailhead has a nice 3D model of Longs and a ranger will be happy to show you the exact line. Descent is a downclimb of the same route (raps possible from the eye bolts) or via the standard Keyhole route.\",\n",
       " 'Not on the Diamond, but a great easy technical route to the summit of Longs Peak.  Slightly committing with tricky route finding.  We roped up for 5 or so pitches, but other parties may do less or more depending on experience.  Follow the trail through the Boulderfield to the Keyhole.  The route follows the ridge from the Keyhole to the summit.  From the hut at the Keyhole, hike south up the ramp on the east face until below the False Keyhole, and then head straight up (possibly roping up), to the hiker warning sign.  From here, the route finding is slightly tricky, and there are a couple different ways to go.  We headed south across the east face of the obvious tower for a pitch, and from there headed straight up dirty rock (5.6) to the summit of the tower.  From the top, we dropped down the backside about 10 feet to an obvious ledge, and followed it south.  Be very careful as there is much loose rock and the hiking trail is below.  Follow the ledge to the obvious notch before the next large tower.  Scramble south up the obvious ramp, and then break left and head south on narrow ledges across the east face of the tower.  At a right facing corner (possible fixed pin), head straight up the face following the path of least resistance (5.6).  This is another possibly tricky route finding section.  Once you reach an obvious ledge system near the crest, continue working south on the east side.  Cross to the west side at a notch, and work your way up onto the summit ridge, and follow it to the top. ',\n",
       " 'This route ascends the right side of the prominent buttress in the center of the north face. It is about halfway between the Cables Route and the Keyhole Ridge. This route is nice alternative to the Cables Route if you want some variety. The technical difficultes are about four pitches long, so it is much longer than the one-pitch Cables route. Since it is on a buttress it is free of snow much earlier than the Cables Route and can be climbed in rock shoes (temperatures permitting) in winter.  Ascend the lower rock buttress from the left or right side. The left side is shorter if coming up from the Boulder Field and looks easier and more rock intensive. At the top of the lower buttress things look pretty intimidating - much steeper than you expect. Head up and slightly right to get into a left angling dihedral/gully system. The route is characterized by climbing up a number of left angling systems and then making tricky moves to get from one system up to the next system.  There are good, albeit small, belay ledges.

       " 'Climb the Keyhole route to the Keyhole.  Continue on halfway to the Trough.  Just as the route starts to drop, there is a gully that shoots upward from the ledges toward the Keyhole Ridge.  Be careful as there is an earlier gully that will not take you high enough.  Ascend this gully.  The difficulties are mostly class 4 for about 800 feet or so.  Watch as the hundreds of people on the keyhold route drop away and you are left solo.  Be especially careful not to dislodge any of the loose rock, as it will go right across the path of people on the ledges.  Finally easy passage is blocked by a 50 foot cliff.  Go up the right side and then cross to the left on an easy ledge system.  You are now at the base of the technical pitch.Thirty feet of 5.2 rock rises above you, but it is likely to be covered in water, so it will be harder that this.  Climb halfway up and you have the choice of either climbing under a huge boulder and out the top or going back out over the cliff face and making a difficult move to reach easier ground.  From above the cliff, the route goes on easy rock to reach the Keyhole Ridge just above the technical parts of that route.  Follow the summit ridge (a spectacular and narrow ridge) 150 yards to the summit.  Revel in the fact that everyone on the mountain can see you traverse up this unusual finish.',\n",

Follow this (about 300-400 feet) around a buttress, and then switchback right on rising ledges to reach the boulder/talus slopes directly beneath the Loft.  Hike to the Loft, and then cross over to its northwest corner.    CLARK\\xc2\\x92S ARROW (4th class):  The initial goal is to find the correct access point to Clark\\xc2\\x92s Arrow, which is the route connecting the Loft to the Homestretch (on the Keyhole).  It runs beneath the Palisades, a dramatic, west-facing cliff band between the Loft and the Notch.   The trick I\\xc2\\x92ve been using for many years:  angle to the right (north) side of the flat expanse that is the Loft as you cross to its west side.  When the ground starts to rise (on the right), don\\xc2\\x92t go any higher.  Just pick a contour and follow it (that is, follow the juncture of the flat plain and the rising slope on the right).  As you reach the far corner of the Loft, and begin turning to the north, slowly descend along a cairned path through boulders.  Turn a rib, and arrive at the top of a (roughly west or NW-facing) gully.  Descend (3rd class) to a brief 4th class step.  Continue down another 3rd class section to a little drop off where a large boulder is wedged into the gully.  This section is the crux (4th class), a steep slot along the underside of the boulder.  It can be avoided on the right (facing down) with a neat little face (easier 4th class) that begins ten feet higher, and eventually leads to the same spot.  Scoot down one more short, loose section (3rd class) and then cross a rib to the right (exiting the gully).  It is here where John Clark, a Longs Peak ranger in the early days of the Park, painted a white arrow on the rock buttress overhead to mark the way.  Don\\xc2\\x92t worry if you can\\xc2\\x92t find it \\xc2\\x96 it is very easy to miss when traversing from the Loft to the Homestretch, and there\\xc2\\x92s no guarantee you\\xc2\\x92ll see it on the return trip.  Once the rib is crossed, the rest of the route is very straightforward:  traverse beneath the Palisades to the backside of the Notch (mostly 2nd class), cross left over the head of Keplinger\\xc2\\x92s Couloir (exposed 3rd class, and often some snow), and join the Keyhole route at the base of the Homestretch.  700 feet of polished rock leads to the summit.  SKYSCRAPER (5.0):  If things are going well and the weather is good, this is a highly recommended way to finish Clark\\xc2\\x92s Arrow.  Scan the wall on the right while traversing over the top of Keplinger\\xc2\\x92s Couloir.  About halfway between the Notch and the Homestretch, a curious tower should show up on the skyline (see photo).  Skyscraper takes the 600-foot crack system that passes the tower on the left to reach the southeast ridge of Longs \\xc2\\x96 it\\xc2\\x92s essentially a steeper version of the Homestretch.  Three long pitches are required with a 200-foot rope, followed by a pitch-and-a-half on the SE ridge.  The first pitch starts out very easy, building to a 5.0 finish; a good ledge appears on the right as the rope comes tight.  The second pitch steps left into a left-facing V-slot, with solid jams in the back and good stemming opportunities (several sections of 5.0).  Belay at the end of the rope in a tight stance on some chockstones.  The third pitch is 4th class for most of the way (be careful of loose rock), with a 5.0 bulge at the top; belay on the spacious SE ridge (marvelous views).  One more awesome stretch (300 feet of 4th class on perfect rock) follows the ridge to the summit of Longs:  weave right and then left to negotiate the huge, stacked blocks on the steepest section.  NOTES 1)  Ratings vary to some degree depending on season, and exact line chosen.  The hardest parts on The Ramp to Clark\\xc2\\x92s Arrow are:  A) 3rd class to gain the right side of the Ramp, often done on snow; B) easy 3rd class to cross the Ramp in good conditions; C) Two short (10-15 ft) spots of 4th class on Clark\\xc2\\x92s Arrow in the descent from the Loft to the base of the Palisades; D) 3rd  class to cross head of Keplinger\\xc2\\x92s Couloir in dry conditions, though it\\xc2\\x92s often sketchy 4th class, especially when the snow isn\\xc2\\x92t soft; E) the Homestretch is hard 2nd class to 4th class depending on season. 2)  The Loft can also be reached via Lambs Slide (superb way to start the day:  1500 feet of classic snow climbing).  In soft snow conditions (much of the winter and into early summer), one can also make a rapid descent from the Loft by carefully glissading (or plunge stepping) Lambs Slide. 3)  Add a great pitch of 4th class by ascending the stepped slabs just left of the standard route as you approach the right side of the Ramp. 4)  In winter conditions, expect a snow gully on the way to the Loft (it doesn\\xc2\\x92t melt out until mid summer).  It\\xc2\\x92s very mellow until the last 200 feet, where it gets steeper.  The Ramp is also filled in with snow (4th class, and much spookier).  Once the buttress is turned on the Ramp, it is generally easier to go more-or-less straight up steep snow, rather than perform the switchback described above.  The head of Keplinger\\xc2\\x92s Couloir holds a snowfield for much of the year, and this can be the scariest part of the route, as it\\xc2\\x92s difficult to protect and a fall would have serious consequences.  Skyscraper fills in during the winter and spring, becoming a wild, tight run of alpine snow (similar in difficulty to a summer ascent, though a little more exposed).  An axe is a must in winter; you can get away without crampons some of the time (bring them for a winter ascent of Skyscraper).  EXTRA CREDIT:  It takes 15-30 minutes to bag the summit of Mt Meeker from the Loft.  The summit of the Beaver (about 14,025') is also easy to reach from the Loft (a little longer).  The Beaver is the portion of the SE ridge that runs from the Loft to a wild drop-off into the Notch.  If you bring ropes for the rappel into the Notch, this is yet another option for approaching the summit. \",\n",
       " \"The Ship's Prow is the comparatively small crag to the south (left) of Chasm Lake on the way up to the Diamond of Long's Peak. While it seems diminutive at first glance, it's actually a good, steep cliff ranging from 300-500 feet tall -- it just looks small because of the backdrop.  The routes here are all trad, with the exception of Bologna Pony and Sarchasm on the far right.  In 2004-6, Topher Donahue has put up some 5.13s here, Yardarms, Etch-a-Sketch, and The Keel Haul.  There is plenty of room for development especially along the continuation of South-facing side Ship's Prow which is also known as Glacier Ridge.  Descent either are done by rappel, continuing west on the ridge to the West side of Chasm Lake, or a treacherous ramp right of the Great Dihedral (consider rappels in here).\",\n",
       " 'This is an airy, exposed but totally safe journey up the impressive hanging arete on the far right side of the Ship\\'s Prow (the north-facing side just above Chasm Lake). An awesome route in its own right, this is also a good Plan B tick if things are looking wet and/or ominous on the Diamond.  P1: (12a) Though the cracks on the sunny east side of the arete beckon, the first pitch actually climbs a thin, tips splitter around the right side of the arete, on the north-facing wall. Climb a 1.5\" crack up to a roof. A bolt and a fixed stopper take you past a crux and into sustained 5.11 territory. Once the crack ends at a pegmatite blob, finger-tip traverse left past a fixed nut and a bolt (crux #2) to the arete, then climb easy ground to a double-bolt belay. If you\\'re feeling heroic, drop a line in on Tommy Caldwell\\'s Sarchasm (14a), the bolted line up the arete proper.  P2: (11+) This is a short but stout pitch that takes you out to a spectacular belay on the hanging arete. Climb easy corners (thin gear) up and right, then move left past three bolts on funky slopers to reach the belay.  P3: (12c) Possibly one of the best sport pitches around! Hats-off, kudos, and props to Pat and Jim for their multiple trips up to the Ship\\'s Prow to hand-drill the 13 bolts on this pitch. This pitch is in your face right off the belay -- climb very overhanging rock on the undercut arete, pimping slopers, little crimps, and funky pinches. As the angle relents, so does the climbing. Tricky route-finding and devious cruxes on the upper arete and face will have you on your toes all the way to the double-bolt anchors at the top of the prow.   NOTE: This pitch is exactly 30 meters long -- you can get back to the belay with a 60-meter rope and your second can top-rope to clean the draws. Bring a 60 meter trail line and you can double-rope rappel straight to the ground from the belay at the base of this pitch. This is probably the easiest -- and safest -- way off the route. Rapping the route with a single line would involve lots of swinging around in space, kicking desperately at the wall to get back in to the lower set of anchors, and is *not* recommended.',\n",

       " \"This is a moderate route that can go down quickly with a mere half, or nay... quarter-day's work, and not hard labor. It took us just over 2 hours bottom to top on this one. The rock is mostly solid, the protection is mostly good (though well-spaced at times), and the line is mostly obvious.  Half Day's Work starts up in the right-facing corner system to the left of the start of Man Overboard and Portal. The route starts by ascending up this system in 2 pitches total continuing up and left the entire way past some old pins, particularly 3 old pins in a tight group near the top, near a crux, and just before a grassy ledge. With judicious use of slings, this can all be linked in a single pitch just under 60m long.  From  belay on that ledge, the route goes slightly left and then up and right on slightly lower angled rock with an easier technical grade but occasional short runouts. The route leans hard right here and crosses up and over a peerless slab of rock to reach a large ledge with another old pin belay from the 1960s aid ascent. This lies just to the right side of the last 20' of the major buttress that lies up against the main cliff, and can be backed up with gear. It is perhaps 120' for this pitch.  The next pitch climbs up from the pin belay and left onto solid rock. The right-facing corner to the right of the belay is overhung, separated from the main wall, and dirty/chossy. Go up and left then back right at the very peak of the buttress, then pull up to and into a chimney on the right (poorly protected in spots, but moderate) or a left-facing corner on the left (more technical, but less of a grunt), and shoot up more than 60m to the top of the wall, belaying if you feel the need, or simul-climbing for a way otherwise, unless you have an 80m rope.  Arrive on the top, and find something to belay off of that you feel good about.  It took me some searching to get a long cord around some big boulders that were bomber.

The climb is rated as 5.9 and as 5 pitches, traditionally, but it can easily be done in 3. Each pitch is 5.9.  The route is short for a true alpine route (450 feet?) and is fairly well protected.

Approach Ship\\'s Prow from Chasm Lake and come to the obvious, left-leaning chimney/ramp. This is P1 of Portal. The first pitch is wet, mungy, and nasty.

The clean dihedral occasionally sews shut, but a crack to one side or the other always appears for gear and good holds. Belay off of placements up in a notch with a small but good ledge with a 60m rope, with minimal line left.  P3: (5.9, 120\\') Climb up through the chimney to the back of it, reaching a wide dihedral. Stem out to other walls and blocks for a while (5.6, S?) and continue on, setting small gear in cracks when you can. Reach a crux at a wide crack and lever up with a few funky, tricky stoppers at your waist (or a 5-7\" piece wherever you like, if you hauled one up there) to an easier section to top out.

This starts solid and easy, but gets harder and has poor rock as you continue to the last bolt before the belay. This pitch can be done as a scrunch problem (better = shorter) with a reach crux or a reach problem with a scrunch crux.

It shows the belay, fixed pro, and climbing on the right of the arete... (where it is not).

Pitch 1: Climb blocky terrain up to the double crack system inside a shallow chimney.  Climb this system then work left, around an arete and up easy terrain to a belay.   Pitch 2: Climb right up a slab/ramp then up towards a ledge system below (from left to right) two left-facing, corner systems and steep chimney.  Pitch 3: Climb the steep, dirty, but surprisingly fun, chimney system to a wild exit traverse right.  Work up then step left around an arete to an excellent belay ledge.  This chimney worked well for a winter ascent, but summer climbers may prefer the left-facing corner about 15 feet left of this chimney.  Pitch 4: Step back right into perfect double crack system in a less then vertical corner leading to a roof.  At the roof, traverse right, climb up then back left and around an arete.  Continue up wide cracks then up a short, right facing corner to an amazing belay stance below the crux headwall.  Watch the rope drag on this pitch and be sure to use an extra long runner before traversing out from under the roof.  Pitch 5: Climb up the east-facing headwall following multiple crack system topping out onto the south face. Continue up splitter cracks on the south face passing a few blank slab sections on your way to the tiny summit.  Descent:  From the summit, rappel south.  With a single 60m rope, five rappels will get you to the top of the upper right arm of Lamb's Slide.  Winter ascents: this route lends itself well to a challenging winter ascent.  Our ascent on 11-7-09 is one of the best routes I've ever done in the mountains.  Most of the route can be climbed with gloves and boots; the occasional bare-handed move is required.  The route had everything: classic snow climbing leg workouts, dry splitter cracks, hard mixed climbing and exposed slab climbing in mountain boots.  I drytooled the crux headwall but without crampons on.  The bare soles stuck better to the rock and didn't leave behind scratch marks. My partner followed the pitch bare-handed with his pack on his back and mine hanging from his harness, until he could get high enough clip my pack to the tail of the rope I had lowered down.  We topped out late and rapped down in the dark, finishing the day by kicking countless steps down the upper right arm of Lamb's Slide by headlamp.\",\n",
       " \"Mention Long's Peak to a climber and you'll immediately conjure images the Diamond. And with good reason... the East Face of Long's is the most striking alpine wall in Colorado. At some point, every trad climber on the Front Range entertains the notion of climbing it. As amazing as the East Face is though, there are other parts of this mountain that deserve attention. Perhaps the most overlooked of these is the West Face.   The 600-foot West Face of Long's fills a unique niche in Rocky climbing. For starters, the climbing begins above 13,000 feet and tops out on the only Colorado 14er north of I-70. The rock is excellent and low angle, which translates into lots of 3-4 pitch lines in the 5.6-5.9 range. The views are truly sublime and the potential for first ascents is huge.  None-the-less, only a handful of documented routes have been established on this quarter mile wide cliff. Why?  The West Face is remote. The easiest approach is via the Keyhole route with translates to a 7-mile hike and an elevation gain of 3,500 feet. This also means that you'll be sharing the trail with the many hikers who are attempting the Keyhole route. These hikers pass directly below West Face on their way to and from the summit so extra care to avoid rockfall is absolutely required! A camp in the Boulderfield turns this wall into a moderate alpine crag but you need to make reservations with the Park Service months in advance.  For what it is, the West Face is a great place. If you're looking for a moderate outing in the high country, and you don't mind hiking, the West Face may be the perfect choice.\",\n",
       " 'We had a hard time discerning the actual route even with descriptions from both guidebooks, which were vague. We have no idea if we took the correct route, but what we did for the most part followed the path of least resistence and felt like 5.7 climbing.   The first pitch is supposed to start at a 4 inch crack, which we found, but the crack itself didn\\'t last for very long and then turned into a system of flakes and shallow dihedrals and ended at a stance overlooking the \"trough\" on the right after about 180 feet of climbing (not the \"Trough\" on the Keyhole Route, but what Rossiter\\'s route description decribes as a \"trough\" up the rock face, which Gillett describes as a \"concave face\"). Our second pitch went up a shallow, RFD on the left side of the trough, and we belayed at a small stance where the dihedral becomes larger and the angle steepens to nearly vertical. This pitch ended up being less than 100 feet, because I wasn\\'t sure where the third pitch went as well as if there would be a better belay stance above me. From here, we eventually decided to traverse right into righthand side of the trough, climb up a short ways, then traverse right to the LFD on the other side of the trough. From here, we followed a nice hand and fist sized crack (with plentiful face holds) straight up (approximately 60 feet?) to where it made sense to traverse left on face holds back to the other side of the trough, then up through flakes and shallow, RFDs to a good belay stance on a small grassy ledge at the base of a prominent, large, RFD. Our 4th pitch went up about 40 feet of vertical terrain to where the angle eases off and the features become blocky and the climbing becomes more scrambly, although you\\'ll still find plenty of 5th class moves. This pitch stretched the rope to almost 200 feet and ended a few feet below the actual Keyhole Ridge, which is an easy scramble to the summit.',\n",

       " \"Mt. Alice is a relatively remote 13,000 foot peak located deep in Wild Basin of RMNP.  The climbs are located on its steep, impressive, and intimidating east face, and consists of mostly older aid lines with the exception of Central Ramp (5.8) which is probably the most popular route.  Like all alpine climbs, these routes should not be taken lightly.  This is especially true for Mt. Alice due to its remote location (8 miles back).  Don't expect to see crowds.  It's likely you'll be the only party there. Since these routes don't see a lot of traffic, you should expect dirt, loose rock, and lots of plant life. A true backcountry/alpine experience.  The climbs start part-way up the face.  They are accessed by hiking up the snow chute on the left (a little steep) or by cutting up and across from the right on a 3rd-4th class ramp which is a spicy in a couple spots (we roped up for part of it).

The long approach means that you have a good chance of being the only party on the mountain.

To reach the base of the route you have a few options. A) Climb the obvious snow tongue on the left. B) Climb a couple easy pitches starting just to the right of the snow. C) Climb the ramp, which approaches from the bottom right. (4th class and loose) I started down this ramp once and quickly decided that it was too nasty. It is probably better going up. My preference is the snow if it is soft enough to kick steps.

A nice alternative is the beautiful 5.8 dihedral on the left. It has decent pro and offers some excellent stemming.   (2) From the top of the first pitch, you have a choice of following the huge right-facing dihedral up the left edge of the ramp or a left-facing dihedral/crack system that runs up the center/right side of the ramp. This is a description of the right option. Stretch the rope up to a small ledge below a 3-foot roof that runs diagonally up and to the right. 5.7   (3) Traverse up and right staying under the roof until you reach a large chimney with lots of features, including a couple choke stones. Continue up this chimney until it is possible to exit left onto a short ramp/ledge system.

Then continue up another 30 feet to a nice hand crack in an open corner. From the top of the hand crack, a ramp leads up and right to the top of the route. 5.8  The descent also offers a few options. A) Descend to the south and then the southeast to gain the grassy southeast face of Alice and follow this back to east side of Alice. B) Descend to the south along the Continental Divide until you reach Boulder Grand Pass. Descend on the north side of the snow and take the pass back to the Thunder Lake trail.

       " 'The Flying Buttress is one of Rocky\\'s alpine classics, and is unique compared to the typical big faces and pinnacles throughout most of the Park.  It follows a steep and narrow rib of rock (the west-most of several on Meeker\\'s North Face), presenting moments of sudden exposure and fantastic belays on the narrow rib itself.  There are so many variations that about 3 separate routes could be described; in Richard Rossiter\\'s guide about 10-12 people are credited with various FAs and FFAs.  We took a line often called \"Variations on a Theme\", which I will describe, pointing out other major variations from time to time.  As mentioned, the route follows the right-most of about three rock ribs that protrude from Meeker\\'s north face.  The long, broad gully leading up to the saddle between Longs and Meeker lies to the right, and the rib itself is bound on either side by smaller gullies that hold some snow for most if not all of the year.  From the ranger cabin, hike up talus slightly SE to the rib.  Rack up at the base of some long third-class scrambling which leads up to a smooth prow where the 5th class begins.  The easiest line takes the right-most dihedral on the east side of the rib and finishes in a chimney for a 150 foot pitch.  We started in an excellent 5.8 hand crack on the right side of the prow itself.  This line traverse left through a juggy dark band, then picks up a beautiful left-leaning finger crack (sustained 5.10).  Continue weaving back and forth across the rib for another 40 feet to a good belay ledge.  P2 - Continue directly up the obvious line on the prow (5.10a at first, then easier), or a great variation takes the dihedral just around the corner.  If following that line, continue on the left side until exposed 5.9- moves lead to a fantastic belay ledge with 2 old bolts (150 feet).  P3 - A little tricky: head up left on the prow to pick up a 5.8 crack and flake.  Then traverse right beneath the obvious roof past an old bolt, and climb around the roof on the right past pitons, with great exposure, 5.9-.  Continue up the much easier prow and run out all the rope (60m rope handy to reach a good ledge).  The obvious three-inch crack (5.9+ jugs) through the left side of the roof is probably the best way to do this pitch, though, and may be the most spectacular part of the route.  P4 - Continue easily up on the right side of the prow for 60-100 feet to a belay beneath the final steep corner.  P5 - Climb the hand/fist crack in the corner, exit right, and continue to the top of the rib.  Unrope here and scramble (3rd-4th class) across the exposed top of the rib (staying right where it rears up briefly).  This brings you to a horizontal break on Meeker\\'s north face.  One can continue to the summit via low-5th class to the east, or take one of several steep 5.10ish lines on the 200 foot wall above (seldom done).  Most parties head west to 4th class scrambling (or snow sliding) back to the base.    Special Considerations: the route goes in 4 pitches with a 60m rope; done this way it is one of the fastest grade IIIs in the Park (of 8-9 that I have done).  The climbing on the 5.9 pitches is not very sustained.  2 ropes is probably overkill on this route as it is possible to make a quick retreat down either side of the rib at almost any point (looks like one or two rappels, with a number of fixed anchors); one 60m rope is certainly enough, though trepid parties with a mere 50m might want to toss in a trail line.  If you do go to the top of Meeker (west summit is the highest), the descent is made from the Loft (the broad saddle between Longs and Meeker): from there head east and down to a well-cairned ledge system that bypasses some cliffs (this point can be reached fairly directly by scrambling down from the summit of Meeker).  The ledges deposit you at 3rd class scrambling or possibly snow sliding (not the same as the descent from the top of the rib).',\n",

The first pitch (5.6ish) follows a right facing flake, then heads up and left following a corner system to a large ledge system.  You will have to cross some snow to reach the rock in the early season.  P2. The second pitch follows some bolts through an impressive looking roof.  Step left from the bolted anchor, and boulder up the tricky face to the first bolt.  Get a TCU or two in under the roof, and then reach up and clip the bolt over the lip to the right.  If you're onsighting this pitch, expect a solid to hard 5.11 effort, and remember to follow the holds not the bolts.  I'd be wary of placing a larger cam in the roof itself.  Once situated above the roof, follow the crack/corner/flake system up and left, then step right to a bolted belay on a narrow ledge.  If you end up lowering back to the starting ledge from the bolt over the roof (either leading or seconding), you're in good company.  That's as far as I got, though I'm definitely going to go back and complete the job.  The third pitch (5.11) begins to the left of the anchor - follow a couple bolts up the face, aim for an arch, pass another bolt, and head up right to the bolted anchor.  The fourth pitch (5.10+) follows a conspicuous corner to the top of the wall and is apparently spectacular.  Per Josh Janes: P3: Again extend the anchor out left. Step up off the belay ledge and perform thin 5.10 moves past two bolts. Continue up and left on runout 5.9+/5.10- climbing to a rest ledge. Head straight up and out the right side of an arch and pass another bolt (difficult moves here). Wander up and back right on more run outs to a final bolt and cruxy move. Belay at a bolted anchor. 5.11- PG/R, 120'  Per Josh Janes: P4: Head straight left off of the belay and follow a discontinuous corner up to a roof below the obvious huge, hanging, right-facing corner at the top of the wall. Step up into the corner and climb it to the top. Coldshuts out left. This is an amazing pitch. 5.10, 150'.  You can rap from the top of P2 with a single 60M rope.  Two ropes are required to rap the entire route, although the walkoff isn't too long.  The approach takes a little longer than going to the Flying Buttress, and the talus is loose and trailess.  FWIW, out of a dozen or so routes I've done in RMNP, I've only had trouble with marmots here and at the Flying Buttress (one ate a hole in my hat). \",\n",
       " \"Notchtop is a spectacular mountain, offering climbing on par with anything in the Park short of Long's Peak. It offers a beautiful, steep South Ridge, an excellent mountaineering route, and some hard 5.11 testpieces.  The only thing not to like is the dangerous and confusing descent.  The mountain has 2 summits: that of the spire which is separated from the main peak by the namesake notch, and the summit of the main peak.  If you value your life, DO NOT summit the spire!  It is composed entirely of loose, fractured blocks which could (indeed have) easily give way at any moment.  If your route leads to a point very near this summit, then find a 4th class scramble south of it that turns into a ledge, which in turn leads west to the actual notch.  From the notch, go 3rd class west to the main summit.  Then, find a 4th/5th class ledge SYSTEM which gradually descends below a craggy ridge, near the top of the peak's SW face.  This ledge is very exposed in spots and cuts across the top of several very steep gullies (some of which have rappel slings-- DO NOT rappel these gullies, however!).  Make your return to the base of the cliff ONLY when an obvious, wide, talus filled third class gully leads to the SE. This descent would be even more treacherous if it was wet or dark.  Rope up if you are at all unsure.  Richard Rossiter's guidebook (which is usually very good) contains some dangerous misinformation about this descent.  NOTE: there is apparently a new rap route (not described in any guidebook) which offers passage down the SW face, but I know nothing about it.  Possible beta may be had at climbing shops in Estes Park, et al...or not.  This subarea only contains rock routes.Notchtop ice/mixed routes.\",\n",
       " \"The recommended variation to the original South Ridge route.  An inspiring, steep line from below, it offers a surprising amount of crack climbing (Colorado style at any rate).  We found it to be a relatively fast grade III compared to others I've done in the Park.  Hike up a short ways past the mountain's SE corner, and find a ramp that cuts back to the right.  Go up that to the base of the route.  The first 2 or 3 pitches are easy 5th class, with many variations possible (usually simul-climbed).  At a point where the wall steepens considerably, reach the highest of several terraces, a long ledge that runs off to the right.  Almost all of the route occurs just to the right of the actual arete.    P1 - Face climb up and left for half a rope-length, to a ledge below a right-facing dihedral (5.6).   P2 - Climb the  hand and fist crack in the back of the dihedral, turn the airy roof with interesting moves, and face climb right, then back left to a belay--an excellent, exposed pitch. (5.9, 130 feet)  The fist crack after the roof is very nice looking and seems to be the natural line, but I don't know how difficult it is (not in any guide).   P3 - Head straight up the crack at 5.8 and belay on a ledge on the other side of the arete/ridge (80 feet)    P4 - Two distinct variations are possible from here.  The direct route  wanders the onto the west face and eventually finds a 5.6 chimney which leads to a belay right on the arete.  People often seem to get lost looking for this chimney-it's pretty far to the left.  Prior to the chimney there's a similar looking slot that's closer to 5.9.  Supposedly there's a 10+/11 seam somewhere in this area as well.  P5 of the direct route heads up and right to a beautiful, steep 5.9 crack.  This pitch can easily be combined with P6, which is a 5.7 corner/groove.  The original finish (from the top of P3) is as follows:  1) from the belay, traverse right across a prominent slab for 30 feet, and ascend a series of 5.8 cracks and corners slightly up and right to a belay in a large dihedral.  2) climb the dihedral to the top (5.7).  Both pitches were fairly long.  Both variations end on the Notch Spire directly above the descent.\",\n",

Climb the corner until you reach a large ledge on the right and belay. For the next pitch go left into a large gully system and climb over to the rest of religion.  Although the features are striking the rock is not the best. The lower portion is exfoliating, and the corner has some lichen on the face, and a loose, quartz dike on the overhanging, right wall.

The initial crack is quite long and continuous. Secondary cracks and features are just left of the main crack, which affords you a variety of gear opportunities. The first 40ft is sustained, but it relaxes after that with large foot ledges.   After the initial crack, a ledge with a small gully leading right appears. I went up the gully and found another crack system and a tiny roof. This had more moss and lichen, but was good in any case. Turn the roof and go way right or head straight up.

       " 'Begin the approach at the Bear Lake parking Lot.  Go around Bear Lake counter-clockwise a short ways until the Fern Lake trail angles off to the right.  Watch for several trail junctions.  Each one is well signed.  Just follow directions for Fern Lake.   At 2.8 miles from Bear Lake, the trail reaches a saddle between Joe Mills Mountain and Notchtop Mountain.  Look for a very obvious trail to the left that descends to Lake Helene.  There is no sign for this trail, but it is easy enough to stumble across. Work counter-clockwise around Lake Helene.  At the end of the lake, follow the trail uphill.  The trail is braided, but keep an eye out for the path that is most well used.  Eventually, the path works its way up through a gully.  The upper part of this gully can contain a small snow patch until mid-summer.  Always keep an eye out for cairns and the best path as it goes over a series of rock humps to reach a small lake at the base of Notchtop\\'s south ridge at 0.7 miles from Lake Helene.  With Notchtop\\'s south ridge soaring above, work across the bottom of the lake and uphill to the left, through mild talus and grassy slopes.  After entering the gully, look for a ramp going up to the right that would lead back to the south ridge.  It should look very easy and is in a small cirque with large boulders at its base.  An easy scramble leads to a nice perch on the ridge crest.  This makes a nice place to rope up and/or put on climbing shoes.  With a two hundred foot rope, two pitches can be made of a series of rock steps in the ridge.  These steps are separated by low angle spots that can be used as alternate belays with a shorter rope.  Many different paths are obvious on the initial pitches.  Look for a cool line and enjoy.  Eventually find a belay beneath the south ridge as it increasingly steepens above. A grassy ledge leads right around a spectacular corner.  It is never very difficult and is nicely protected for both the leader and the second.  Stretch the rope out to a belay beneath the east meadow.  The \"notch\" should be visible above you. Follow the path of least resistance for a rambling pitch up the east meadow.  Find a belay beneath a steep headwall that blocks access to the notch.  Look for the easiest path path through the headwall.  It should be a crack on the left that is well protected.  It goes up to a small roof, where a step to the left leads to easy terrain.  This is one of the best pitches on the route.   From the notch, scramble south along a ledge until it is possible to scramble to the summit of the Notch Spire.  Keep in mind that this ledge is on the opposite side of the mountain that the climb was on.  It is very obvious.  Enjoy the summit of the spire.  It is very small and very cool.   After descending the spire,  work uphill to the north.  The goal is to find the West Gully, a third class gully, full of yucky talus, that descends to the lake at the base of the route.  Look for some cairns and and a well worn path.  Several rap stations appear, but the cliffs below are long, and the trail goes right beneath them anyway.  The scramble from the notch to the West Gully is longer and more intricate than would be expected.  Don\\'t worry,  just look carefully for the path everybody else has used before.  Some snow may be in the upper part of the West Gully until mid-summer.  This traverse is not a good place to be caught in a big electrical storm.  Maybe that\\'s why there are several rap stations encountered along the traverse.   Descend the West Gully down to the start of the route.  This is the traverse from the gully to the ridge line.  Pick-up any stashed gear or head directly down to the Lake.  Reverse the approach to Lake Helene and Bear Lake via the Fern Lake trail.

Which one of the 4 \\'shallow left facing corners\\' would you choose?  Once found, the route requires some focus to protect and climb though we felt that pitches 2-5 were all about 1 letter grade easier than rated. All lengths given here are very approximate, as we were using unmarked ropes.  P1: (5.9, ~130\\') From a ledge to the West (left) of the corner of the wall, go a short distance up the ramp and start up a crack, which after some distance becomes a left-facing corner system. Go up this to a good ledge below some nearly parallel cracks and belay. P1 alternate: (5.10, S, ~140\\') Continue up the slab further until you reach an arch of rock forming a roof. Protect on 1\" gear, then pull the roof directly (5.10, S) and then head up and left on poor protection but good face holds (5.7, S) to the same ledge. This can be seen to the right of the line in the beta photo. F.A. Jason Haas & Tony Bubb, July 2006  P2: (5.9, ~110\\') Climb up on the left-most of 3 cracks that are up and just right of the belay.  The right-most of these is harder and poorly protected (5.10, S). When this runs out, head up and left on good face-holds with infrequent protection to reach another ledge. The ledge has a fixed pin with some cord on it and a knot in the crack just left of it, which has obviously been bailed from, but it needed more gear added to be trust worthy as a belay.   P3: (5.10d, crux S, ~80\\') Climb the left-most of several cracks and corners above the belay. This pitch is closer to the arete than how we interpreted the topo proportions in Gillett\\'s book. We did see first of the fixed pins 40\\' over the ledge, though only after a few false starts. The climbing is moderate until it reaches the pin, and then beyond that a little scary and hard. The holds are sloper and require delicate climbing. The pins are difficult to back up and are not of the best quality. Be careful. Continue up the crack to a roof, where you go left and up to a ledge. Be sure to put a long sling on the final 2 pins. We got on the cracks to the right of these and found them to be largely unprotected and outright crumbling in paces before down-leading back to try the correct pitch. Avoid these.  P4: (5.10c, S, 100\\') We combined the final two pitches together with a rope-stretching bid for the summit, relatively assured that if we fell short of it, that we\\'d find belay gear just before it, in the hanging corner. We made it with 2 meters of a 60M left to go.  Climb up and slightly right in a steep corner from the belay (5.9) and then up lower angle rock near the arete to go right and reach a second corner which was the second crux of the climb. Gillett calls this \"Funky 5.10d stemming\" or something to that effect. It is 5.10 on bad RPs with ledges below, so bear this in mind.

The main ridge of Zowie is south-facing, but the sides of the spire are shady gullies. The summit is a few pitches higher than Zowie, and provides interesting views, particularly on the descent.  To descend, rap off a threaded slings from the summit to the northwest (50m) and carefully pick your way down the talus gully between Wham and Zowie. The descent gully doesn't get much sun, so snow and ice may be encountered even when the route is dry. A second rap (25m?) is required to pass over a gigantic chockstone.\",\n",

It is a pinnacle eroded from Otis Peak.There appear to be at least 2 descents.  A. From the top, there is at least one rappel route down.  From the northeast end of the top, there is a 2 bolt ~90' rappel.  (~80' reaches a ledge with an exposed scramble north to the next anchor.)  Note, this rappel can be challenging to pull, so consider using one rope.  The second rappel off a 2 bolt anchor goes down a gully going north to the saddle.  From there, snake your way down exposed 3rd class, traverse skier's right into a chimney, continue snaking down past a notch, and go to a pair of brown, Metolius rap hangers near the bottom of the descent.  Rappel ~80' over a wet chimney.  B. Per John Peterson: The first rap is down the east side (right over the 5.8+ crack). Take a grassy ledge north (right as you face the summit) to an anchor that leads to the notch behind Zowie. This is hard to see from above. Both of these rap stations have good anchors. Follow the gully down until you hit a drop off near the bottom and rap one last time. It looked possible to downclimb, but it would be very exposed. This rap anchor wasn't as good as the other two.\",\n",
       " 'This is just a brief overview/description of the climb:  P1. Head up slope to gully (not descent gully), that is capped by large chockstone. Climb prominent dihedral (right-facing) through a slot up top to a ledge belay.  P2. Continue up cracks, going up easy ledges, and corners. Continue to walkable grass ledge, and up towards the south/west face of spire.  You can walk off left to descent gully from here.  This pitch is long, and to make it up to the bottom of the upper face requires simulclimbing.  P3. Start up left-most dihedral (left-facing) on upper wall.  Exit the dihedral up and left, toward ledge with an optional belay.  P4. Continue up the face using cracks and weaknesses.  Trend up and leftward toward the arete. Pass a KB pin when you get to the arete, continue up arete to large long ledge.  P5. Go up the last part of the tower with a thin crack start, pull up to right (around small corner) up to roof with wide crack, pull out left, and finish up to summit.  Note: there are several good pitches we did that are right of this route.  Some have a pin or two, and one ledge has two old 1/4\" bolts. These are all fun, and about 5.9-5.10 range (I think?) none of these pitches are listed in any books that I could find....',\n",
       " 'As you approach Zowie from the south, you will see the chimney on the West side of the South face, this is the standard route.  On the East side of the South Face there is a \"flatiron\" which is the route described by Bell/MacDonald comments in the South Face description.  Just left (West) of this variation, there is an large, overhanging, left-facing dihedral. The one-star rating accounts for the moss and lichen.  If it were cleaned it could become a classic pitch.  This dihedral starts with some moss and lichen on slopers, but becomes much better after the first 15\\'. There is still much lichen and moss to be avoided or cleaned, but the rock is really quite good and the moves are really fun.  Climb the wall on the right to move up and into the crack.  This is insecure and should not be attempted by novices until it is cleaner.  After 15\\' step left and start stemming and jamming you way up the dihedral and through some overhangs and grooves until you are 100+ feet up and at the end of the dihedral. There are good feet out on the left for all overhangs, so the grade remains mellow.  At the end of the dihedral, step out left toward the arete for a move or two, but be careful to avoid the 1000+ pound death block on a ledge near the arete. Climb up a featured face from there, getting protection as necessary (but not necessarily as desired) and go to a large ledge with gear for a belay.  Continue to the summit on the South Face route.',\n",
       " \"The South Face is the standard route on this less-classic cousin of the Petit Grepon with which it's often compared. Although the quality of the climbing isn't as good as that found on the Petit, it's still a worthy objective with a much shorter approach and a beautiful summit.   To get to the base of the route, head up towards the left side of the  formation, looking for the line of least resistance underneath the prominent chimney system. The first 2 pitches follow this chimney, but it doesn't extend all the way to the ground.   P1 & P2. Both times I climbed the route, I started up a short section of mostly face climbing, immediately right of a small right-facing dihedral. I'd say it was somewhere in the 5.7 - 5.8 range, but there's an easier way a little to the left of this which is rated 5.4. Regardless of how you get into the chimney system, climb until you get to a big ledge that spans almost the entire south face of the spire.   P3. Move your belay east to the other end of the ledge just below a prominent left-facing dihedral. Head up the dihedral (fun) and up the obvious crack system quite a ways and belay on a good ledge. The guidebook calls this pitch 5.6, but I thought it felt more like 5.7.  P4. From what I can remember, there are a couple of crack systems/dihedrals right off the ledge, and it's not all that obvious which way to go, so just pick the one that looks the most traveled and head up. After this fairly short section, the terrain gets lower-angled. Pick the line of least resistance and aim for the right side of the base of the summit tower and a good belay ledge.  P5. This next pitch climbs cracks on the east side of the spire, and from what I remember, we set up a belay on the east side as well, on a big ledge where you can get a good look at cracks going up the east side of the spire, but at a place where the south face isn't quite visible. Short pitch - 5.6.   P6. This super-short pitch traverses the base of the summit tower from east to west, and in the Rossiter guidebook is combined with the pitch I described above in the description but not in the topo. It takes you to the base of the wide crack final pitch, almost to the edge of the southwest arete. 5.6.  P7. This is the pitch you've been waiting for! This and the summit are the reasons that Zowie is a near-classic. Even though it's an off-width, it's best not to climb it like one. My partner tried to do it like that and flailed for half an hour before admitting defeat and taking the 5.8+ thin crack/face variation to the right (also a classic exit pitch - super steep and exposed, with good pro). The trick at the crux (5.8+) bulge is to stay left of the crack and reach high for the key face hold, which I was expecting to be a jug but is really fairly small (but adequate). There's a pin a little ways below the crux but not after, so it's a bit of a heady move. After this, traverse right and up for a short ways and you're on the summit! Hopefully it's a warm sunny day and you can hang out for a while, soaking up the beautiful views of Sharkstooth and the summit of the Saber.   To descend, there are two rap anchors: one on the west side of the summit and one on the north side. Most people rap off the north side and then head west down the gully on the west side of the spire. The other rappel takes you down the steeper west side and is a much longer (mostly free) rappel. I've done this with double 50 meter ropes and had to do a little down-climbing, but with 2 60 meter ropes you probably wouldn't have to. There's one more short (40 feet or so) rappel near the bottom of the descent gully, and after that you're home free. Don't forget to stop and eat the raspberries if you're there in late summer! Mmm...raspberries. D'oh!\",\n",

The season for Chaos runs from approximately June to October, depending on snow. Visitors to RMNP should be prepared for any kind of weather. This includes baking sun, cold drenching downpours, hail, and potentially lethal lightning strikes. The hike back down can be complicated by maneuvering across slippery talus which can lead to a twisted or broken ankle or worse. Make sure you have brought a warm waterproof jacket and plenty to eat and drink. Watch out for altitude sickness if you are coming from lower elevations.  Finally remember that the landing for 95% of the boulders is jagged talus, making a crashpad, preferably several, virtually mandatory. If you seriously injure yourself, you are 2.2 miles and 800\\' elevation from assistance. Bouldering alone here therefore can be a serious matter. Be very careful.

Truly above treeline and substantially farther to hike to, Upper Chaos Canyon is the essence of alpine bouldering in RMNP.

Many RMNP classics are found here as well such as Sunspot, Golden Rows of Flows, and Jade, at V14, one of the country's hardest problems.  As at Lower Chaos Canyon, environmental concerns take priority. Stick to established trails, don't harm vegetation, and avoid altering landings. Stashing pads is bad form and the consensus is that they will be removed, either by other boulderers or rangers. Pack out everything you bring in.  The higher elevation and more exposed position of Upper Chaos Canyon makes it imperative that the visitor be prepared for bad weather. Often the season is shorter up here as snow arrives in the fall. The lengthy talus approach can be dangerously slippery in rain and lightning is a serious threat here during frequent summer thunderstorms. Pack warm clothing and plenty of food and water. As with Lower Chaos Canyon, an injury could be very serious here. Make sure you have plenty of pads. Virtually all of the landings here are on boulders.

Layton Kor put up it\\'s namesake Route in 1962, calling it 5.8. But don\\'t be fooled - every pitch will feel a number grade harder, and it\\'ll make the Petit\\'s equally rated \"South Face\" route feel like a walk in the park. No need to worry about crowds either, thanks to the Petit. I\\'m willing to bet that even its two classics (The Kor Route and the Southwest Corner) have rarely been climbed more than once on the same day.   Descent: You can either climb all the way to the summit (which involves a lot of 4th and easy 5th class ups and downs) and down the back side into The Gash (may require some easy 5th class downclimbing). Once on the talus slope, you can either head down towards the Andrews Glacier trail and back out to the trail you came in on, or traverse east beneath a few smaller spires and descend the gully marked with a cairn, which, after one short rappel puts you back near Sky Pond. The other option is to do the rappel route which starts at the beginning of the summit ridge and which heads down the east face and eventually into the gully on the east side of the formation. It\\'s a good and fairly straightforward route, and from what I remember, most or all of the anchors are slings around blocks or constrictions (except for possibly a couple that are bolted near the bottom) and are set up for double 50 meter ropes. There may also be intermediate slings put in place by retreating climbers who only had one rope.',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t remember much about this route except that it was harder than I expected. Not only the supposed 5.8 crux pitch, which almost everyone considers a sandbag, but nearly every pitch on the route. Even the last of the three \"initial pitches,\" a so-called 5.6, bulged out slightly with delicate moves and tricky protection, and although it\\'s possible that I was off-route, nothing to the left or right looked any easier. Apparently, that\\'s just the nature of routes on The Saber. I heard a story of a well-known Estes climber who struggled on the Southwest Corner route even though he was capable of leading several grades higher. The Saber is no Petit Grepon, and climbers, especially more moderate or less-seasoned leaders, should prepare accordingly.  We began the route high up the east side, near the base of the righthand gully/chimney, on a steep grassy slope (which required a bit of easy 5th class climbing over a short band of rock). From the here, look around for the line of least resistance and traverse diagonally up and left, and eventually staight up for 3 pitches until you reach the large and obvious ledge from where the route officially starts. Move your belay right along the ledge to the base of a distinct left-facing dihedral. This is pitch 1 as discribed in the Rossiter guidebook.  P1) Head up the dihedral to where it peters out, pulling left at a small roof and then up another left-facing dihedral (to the left) to a good ledge. This is the crux pitch and is definitely 5.9 climbing. There\\'s a thin parallel crack running straight up from the belay ledge in which I placed the 2 smallest aliens and the smallest tcu as my anchor; maybe I missed some more obvious gear placements but that was all I could find. It made for a solid set-up, but I\\'d have had a harder time finding a belay if I hadn\\'t had those small cams. Also, after the small roof before the second dihedral, there\\'s another dihedral directly overhead which leads to the same ledge that confused me at first, and which I\\'m glad I didn\\'t take as I\\'m sure it\\'s harder.  P2) Traverse right and up the edge of the face into an easy dihedral which ends at a long grassy ledge. Move your belay right along the ledge to the bottom of a large and obvious left-facing dihedral.  P3) Head up the steep dihedral to a belay behind a pinnacle which you can sling with a cordelette.  P4) Continue up the next dihedral and follow the crack system to the second grassy ledge.  P5) Head up and right into what the Rossiter guide calls \"nebulous\" terrain. He\\'s right: you just have to pick and choose the way that looks easiest and the most straightforward. Ther\\'s a lot of potentially loose-looking flakes and features up here, and the angle stays steep, so climb carefully. You\\'re aiming for a ledge with rappel slings, and it\\'s not that easy to find.   P6) We got stormed off at the base of this pitch, and descended the rap route, but this pitch supposedly goes straight up through a bulge and a v-slot to a notch on the ridge crest, where you can either continue on to the summit (several more easy pitches along a ridge) or start the rappel route.  Descent options are explained in the discription for The Saber.',\n",
       " 'This is a great, exciting route that wanders up the left side of the Saber (Petit Side). If you want to keep the route adventurous (mores so [than] it already is), DO NOT READ FURTHER, just follow [Bernard\\'s] guidebook.   The route description in Bernard Gillett\\'s guide is a bit inaccurate and vague. I was confused by the pitch lengths he gave and the description of some of the pitches.   Also note: The R rating not only applies to the runouts. This route is plagued with lots of lichen, flaky rock and numerous death blocks. It is still a great route though (it resembled a Black Canyon route).  The Pocketknife Does not see sun until nearly 12 noon and it was a bit chilly until then (late June). To begin the route, find the low fifth class ramp that angles up and left (just above the chockstones in the South-east gully). This is the same start for the other Saber routes.  P1: Simul-climb for 350 ft (up to 5.6) up to the second ramp system where the wall steepens. Head to the far left side of this ramp to an obvious right facing dihedral. Establish your belay at the base of the dihedral on nice ledge, ten feet below an older angle piton.   P2 (10b R)-[Bernard\\'s] guide calls this a 230 ft pitch, but is only about 180 ft: Head up the dihedral heading for the obvious chimney which is the pocketknife flake. Follow the finger and tight hand crack to terminus. Wander up and slightly left, using thin edges and incipient cracks while finding obscure gear placements along the way. Head up the Hands to offwidth to chimney crack (5.7/5.8), placing smaller gear to the right of the crack if you so desire. Mount the pocketknife flake and choose from two thin cracks to set an anchor. This is a fun ledge to belay from and this pitch is awesome.  P3 (9 R)-This is a very short pitch 70ft. [Bernard\\'s] guide implies climbing through an overhang, but the overhang is very insignificant and could be confused with the crux overhang, causing some problems: From the right side of the belay ledge head up finger crack. After 20 feet or so, begin to work your way to the left via the path of least resistance, aiming for the obvious corner below the larger roof. Establish your belay here, 20 feet below this roof in a corner with a good pin in it. This pitch has some death blocks on it and you should test all your holds and DO NOT place gear behind them.  P4 (11a, 5.10 R): From the belay, head slightly up and left on \"the [can opener]\" flake. This flake is waiting to go, tread lightly and do not place gear behind it. I did however place a nut down low on the flake (where it seemed a bit more solid) just because otherwise you will be pulling 9+/10- moves on flaky rock, 20 feet above a pin which is part of your belay anchor. Undercling the roof and head out its middle via a nice off fingers to hands crack. Above the roof is exciting face climbing, random gear on lichen covered rock. Head toward the obvious splitter hand crack on the left side of the dihedral. Continue up the dihedral, turn a roof on the right and head further up the dihedral to a small belay ledge with tedious gear for the anchor.  P5 (9+): Again, [Bernard\\'s] description is a bit vague here: We simply headed up to the right (not the left) of the black roof. Above the roof, take the path of least resistance to the summit ridge.  Descent: Head further up the summit ridge, to the right side before the 1st notch, and find a sling around a block. Descend via 4, full 200ft, rappels down the East Face into the Saber/Foil gully. ',\n",
       " 'This route is not really anything new- most if not all of it has likely been done before, if not intentionally, perhaps by lost climbers.  A few \"bail out\" stations of gear and biners (now cleaned) found along the way indicated that at least downward travel had been made from points on the route (although I could not find a good description and documentation for it even combining the books from Rossiter and Gillett).  It is more \"undocumented\" than new. The sustained climbing and position of this route and its long pitches make it one of the best options for the Saber though. So, here I am setting aside a virtual \\'page\\' to describe it. This set of variations climbs on or near the S. E. arete of the Saber for most of its length and every pitch is long and direct. The climbing is solid, less a few \\'alpine elements\\' (loose rock or moss) on ledges and roofs, as would be expected for any alpine route, classic or not.  This line is superior to the Kor Route and as good as the S.W. corner, which I also just did.

P3, 5.10, 190\\': Start as for the first \\'hard\\' pitch of the Kor Route. Move out to the right of the ledge and to the base of the short, shallow, broken left-facing corner, which is only about 50 feet tall when viewed from below. Climb this to its end (old fixed angle is NOT as good as it looks- tap it and watch it wiggle. Though it is buried, it is not tight by the eyes. Continue past the top of the corner in cracks a little past to reach a ledge above (5.8). Mind drag and how much rack you keep on you- this is a long pitch. Step slightly right and climb up the face for a bit into a second right-facing corner as for the S.E. Corner variation (5.10a) this one a hanging corner with a small roof below it. It ends after perhaps 10 meters. Instead of climbing left to another corner, head out right on cracks and seams around to the arete of the route.   You are now on Razor\\'s Edge.   Place gear when possible as it will not always be an option. You will pass a VERY DISTINCT 4-inch thick flake surrounded on both sides and on the 3-foot-across top by a thin finger crack. Place gear here, and make a long move upward to a very thin & delicate (perhaps 1/16\" thick) protruding flake big enough for the tips of 3 fingers (5.10). There is a tiny fixed wire to the left of the aforementioned flakes as of 8/06. Continue up on easier terrain with ledges, and head right to a ledge with a little dirt and grass (5.8 mantle) into a short left-facing corner with a shallow right-facing corner a few meters left of you.  You can see an old, fixed, blue tricam above you in this wider crack to the left. Belay here.  P4, 5.10, 170\\': Climb up and left to the right-facing corner with the fixed tricam. This was a \"bail station\" someone had retreated from. We cleaned the webbing and biner, but the tricam was too well fixed & will likely remain unless you have a hammer. Continue up these cracks (and face where there are no cracks) within arm\\'s reach of the arete, sometimes grabbing and crossing it. If I recall correctly, this is the pitch with the most runouts. I passed a lot of really wide crack (5-8\") that would require a #6 Camalot, or the like, to protect, but the climbing was moderate, and I did not want drag, so I ran it out 50+ feet instead of wander for gear. I remained happy I did not take a truly \\'big\\' piece because it would not have been worth it. The crux will come when on the right side you come up under a roof formed by a very thick flake, slit by a perfect handcrack. Place a 3\" cam or #2 Camalot, and crack this crux (5.10-) to cracks above, and climb cracks to the arete. As holds run out, pull left onto the left side and belay at a horn with a fixed webbing rappel station that can be backed up with gear. The ledge here is good.  P5, 5.9, ~160\\': Climb up and right on cracks and face around the corner, going to a shallow left facing system near the arete, continue up and right to join the corner systems of the S.E. Corner. The Kor route is somewhere to your right, still. Continue to climb up on cracks and corners for a long pitch of 5.9. I would have liked to reference your position relative to the S.E. arete of the Saber, but frankly it is not distinct here, as it is a series of corners and aretes. Gillett shows this area left of the rock\\'s corner, I would have expressed it as being to the right, as you can not look Westward across the South face from here. Roister refers to part of this as the \"Stepped Roofs\" (route 21d) and draws it RIGHT of the arete on the upper half. This reflects no error, just indistinction on the part of the rock up high- the arete loses its sharpness in this series of corners. P7, 5.9, ~120\\': Same as for the S.E. Corner. Continue up the corner system to the low-angle summit edge of the rock. Find a belay here and DO NOT try to go to the initial summit\\'s anchors, and the terrain is low angle and rough and will give horrible drag, even unprotected (I have done this a few times, with terrible results). P8, 5.easy, R, 70\\': Romp up the low angle ledge with the Petit Grepon on your left and the now strikingly beautiful \\'Foil\\' on your right. Go up and over the initial summit to a belay or rap station on its North side. ',\n",
       " 'This route is a nice outing and represents several possibilities in a general area. This is on the S.E. corner of the Saber, left of the Kor Route and Right of the SW corner. The climbing can be generally summarized as good moves on good rock and occasionally lacking protection, but not where it matters. Cruxes are reasonably well protected and also vary in difficulty upon the precise line taken.  P1-2, 5.6, 500\\': Make your way up the SE end of the Saber on moderate and easy terrain (5.6, tops) to the big ledge form where start the various technical routes. This is generally done with some soloing or simul-climbing but represents at least 3 belays without any. You can also climb Snively-Harlin (10b) to get there.  P3, 5.8, 80\\': Same as for the first \\'hard\\' pitch of the Kor Route. Move out to the right of the ledge and to the base of the  short, shallow, broken left-facing corner, which is only about 50 feet tall when viewed from below.  Climb this to its end and a little past to reach a ledge above. This pitch is best run directly into the next pitch and can easily be done as such if you have the rack for it and placed (or did not place) to avoid drag.  P4, 5.10, 100\\': Step left into a long right-facing corner, and climb this up to a ledge and belay (as for the SW corner, remarkably!).  P4a, 5.10, 100\\': (Alternate option A) Step slightly right and climb up the face for a bit into a second right-facing corner, this one a hanging corner with a small roof below it. It ends after perhaps 10 meters, and you climb up and left into an easier corner and face, which joins the standard pitch 4.  P4b, 5.10, 100\\': (Alternate option B) Continue out and right on the ledge from the belay of P3, climbing face just to the right of the arete. This can be climbed to a ledge near the end of your rope, with some cracks just to the right of the arete. If you do this, you will be forced into a alternate pitch for P5 as well- see the \"Razor\\'s Edge\" variation route.  P5, 5.9, 160\\': Join the SW corner route for this pitch. Climb up and left to a left-leaning crack and then continue below a large roof, going left under it to a left-facing corner, then up the corner to a sloping ledge.  Better yet, follow the more direct line \"Razor\\'s Edge\" for a very long pitch and to the summit, having climbed the variation of P4 which accesses it.  P6, 5.9, ~150\\': Climb up and right on cracks and face to reach the right-facing corners nearest the SE edge of the face. The Kor route is to the right and around the corners, out of sight. This pitch may be continued until you reach a suitable belay, or run out of rack or rope.  P7, 5.9, ~120\\': Continue up the corner system to the low-angle summit edge of the rock. Find a belay here, and DO NOT try to go to the initial summit\\'s anchors, and the terrain is low angle and rough and will give horrible drag, even unprotected (I have done this a few times, with terrible results).  P8, 5.easy, R, 70\\': Romp up the low angle ledge with the Petit Grepon on your left and the now  strikingly beautiful \\'Foil\\' on your right. Go up and over the initial summit to a belay or rap station on its North side.   Begin the descent from this anchor or continue with a single rap to the notch and continue to the somewhat distant True Summit which is accessed by Kor Route.',\n",
       " \"The Southwest Corner goes up the obvious, sharp arete/corner on the Saber, and runs parallel to the South Face route on the Petit Grepon. Follow the approach for the Petit, and start about 100 yards right of the South Face route. There are actually a lot of different ways you could start the route, so, just pick a decent looking line, and aim for a big ledge about (at least) 400 feet up. The guide book calls this section fifth class, I dont know about that, but, it's easy enough that you can mostly simul-climb. Either way, move fast since this is a really long route. Continue up to a broad ledge with an obvious, wicked-looking, left-facing dihedral. The dihedral is the crux first pitch of the Kor Route (5.8+)....  Pitch one, the crux, starts on face, moves in a thin left facing corner about ten feet to the left of the Kor Route's first pitch. My partner, Dave, placed an RP in the corner, moved left and up a few feet, then continued up steep face moves to a nice 3 foot ledge, out on the corner about 150 feet up. From here, the route finding is more difficult. However, continue up the corner systems on the arete for about 7 more pitches of mostly 5.9 climbing. Staying pretty much out on the corner. There is some really cool exposure on this part of the route, but also some death blocks, so be very careful! The top of the route is at a block with some slings, which is where the rappel route starts.  Per Dan G0D5H411:  Pitch 1,2 (4th Class to 5.8?): Supposed fourth class climbing takes you 400 feet up the green-tinted base of the formation. Perhaps there IS a 4th class route but we ended up doing this in 2 pitches due to the blocky (scary 5.7) roofs we pulled on each pitch. End on the obvious, large ledge about 10 feet to the right of a ramp that angles up and left towards the arete.   Pitch 3 (5.10): The money pitch. The crux pitch starts 10 feet left of a left-facing dihedral (start of Kor Route, I believe.) Angle up and left on blocky holds towards a bottomless, left-facing dihedral about 25 feet up. I was able to place 3 bomber cams before the dihedral. Sustained climbing for ~80 feet deposits you below an improbable looking crack directly on the face above. Traverse 10 feet left here to a spacious belay ledge.   Pitch 4 (5.8): Take the left-facing dihedral above to a roomy belay on top the block pillar.   Pitch 5 (5.8/5.9): We traversed 15 feet straight left from the belay, then up and slightly back right via a thin seam to get to the base of the wide, left-facing dihedral. It also seemed possible to head straight up from the belay and traverse slightly left and up to reach the bottom of the dihedral. Grunt or finesse your way up the dihedral to a comfortable belay on the right.   Pitch 6: (5.8/5.9): The exposure pitch. Head up 15 feet on unprotected but easy ground until you can traverse left underneath a small overlap on red-ish colored rock. Step around the arete and head up the left-facing dihedral. We ended up following purple to pink to the green belay in the beta photo I posted.   Pitch 7 (5.8/5.9): Continue up one of the many finish options. We ended up traversing furth left on green past a couple scary blocks and up a fun but lichen covered dihedral.   Pitch 8 (5.easy): A short scramble up the blocky top to get on the spire summit proper. A giant slung flake and a smaller, slung horn at the back of the summit singnal the start of the raps.\",\n",
       " \"The Seldom Seen Wall, as the name suggests, doesn't see a lot of visitors but not for any particularly good reason.  The wall is located just up the hill from the super classic (and crowded) south face of The Petit Grepon, and just down and right from the (somewhat) often visited east face of Taylor Peak.  The wall is about 1000 feet tall, and the rock quality is reasonable to good.   The wall can be logically divided into three buttresses, a West, Central and East Buttress.  Little is known about the climbing history of the wall.  It is not mentioned in Bernard Gillett's or Richard Rossiter's guidebooks, but there are at least two old and tattered rappel slings, one on the lower part of the east buttress, and one on the upper part of the central buttress, so at least some climbing has taken place there.\",\n",

       " \"This route could easily have been climbed by Layton Kor years ago and never mentioned.  Maybe he forgot to write it up, or maybe he never even set foot on the face.  Nevertheless, the route is very similar in character to the Kor Route on The Saber, hence the name.  The route has seen some previous activity, we found the tattered remains of a rappel station on top of pitch two.  Pitch 1: climb straight up to the base of a prominent, left-facing dihedral (5.8, 150 feet).  Pitch 2: climb up the left-facing dihedral.  The crux is just above the belay and a touch run-out but reasonably secure. Continue up the dihedral to a large belay ledge (5.10 PG-13, 180 feet).  Pitch 3: climb cracks on the steep, right side of the dihedral to avoid lower quality climbing in the corner proper.  Gain and then follow a chimney system behind a giant flake.  From the top of the flake, continue up to a large ledge system (5.10-, 190 feet).  Scramble up to the top of the ledge system.  From here, it is possible to  take a side trip left for a close up view of the Central Buttress.  For the route, scramble up, right and around the South East ridge and onto the east face.  Pitch 4: climb cracks up, then trending left on exposed terrain following the southeast ridge onto the south face (5.8R, 180 feet).  Traverse right on easy 3rd class terrain and grassy ledges for about 120 feet and set a belay at the base of the upper east face.  Pitch 5: climb discontinuous cracks trending up and right towards a large bulge.  Traverse right below the bulge to a belay (5.8, 150 feet).  Pitch 6: climb up and left on steep terrain past the easier right side of the bulge.  Higher up the climbing gets easier.  Stretch the rope and belay wherever looks good (5.8, 180 feet).  Pitch 7: climb up easy terrain to gain and then ascend an easy chimney which ends at the top of the east buttress and a stone's throw from the Continental Divide (5.6, 150 feet).Walk west to the gully between the Seldom Seen Wall and the east face of Taylor Peak.

       " \"Sharkstooth is big tower of quality rock located near to the super-popular Petit Grepon.  You can get at some routes on the south side by the same approach as the Petit, but the north side requires a somewhat hidden split in the trail a little above Loch Vale along the Andrew's Glacier trail.  Then you have the boulder field from hell that goes up the Gash to the base of Sharkstooth.    The descent from the summit is not bad, but we did it with double ropes which always makes the raps quicker.  If you head east from the summit you will find a little notch and some rap rings.  They don't look terrific, but they were good enough for us to simurappel off of them.  About 50 meters down we found some grassy ledges and a slung horn with more rap rings.  Another 50 meters or so and more grassy ledges with rap rings.  The third rap is short and then your at the top of the Gash.  Hike down the unstable boulders, pick up the gear you left at the bottom of your route and then trek out the same nasty boulder field you came up.    All right, after all that negativity about the approach, let me just say that the rock is awesome.  It was probably the best alpine route I have done in my limited career.  The rock is pretty solid and there were great views.  We were in the sun the whole way up.  The Sharkstooth is a great day and well worth the approach.\",\n",
       " 'This route follows the standard descent route,  so get an early start.  You will want to be on the last pitch by the time the folks on the northest ridge route finish.  There is some loose rock at the end of the first rap.  To get to the start of the climb, scramble up the east side of Sharkstooth.  There are great views looking down at the Petit Grepon from the start of the climb.  P1:  Scramble up the start of the gully and work out a belay on the right side of the headwall. (easy 5th class)  P2: Make a rising traverse to the left through the headwall.  Continue upwards, and belay above a 25 foot, right-facing dihedral.

I think that there are other varitions, but this is how we climbed the route.  Angle left through the headwall and end up on the prow.  Peek over the edge and check out the amazing exposure.  Head straight up the arete with steep face and crack climbing.  There are a few fixed pitons on this pitch.  This pitch gets three stars.

       " 'From the Andrew\\'s Glacier trail, you will see the Sharkstooth to the south.  Hike up the Gash, which is the large boulderfield between you and the rock.  As you get near, there will be a long fin of rock coming off the northeast ridge and heading, guess which direction...northeast.  Climb to the east of that and scramble up on some large ledges for the first pitch.    P1. The first pitch can start in several places that are all about 5.4-5.6.  I\\'d say we ran about 160 feet of rope on the first pitch.  There are probably several places you could rig a belay.  P2. The second pitch was similar to the first 5.4-5.6 climbing, about the same distance and straight up the northeast ridge.  Not a lot of zigzagging on this route.  P3. The third pitch goes 5.6 in the guidebook, but it was probably the crux pitch, in other words, it was more difficult than the first two.  The guidebook says startup a left-facing dihedral.  Well, I didn\\'t see any of those.  I saw a big right facing dihedral and then a crack about 4 feet to the right of that.  The dihedral looked tough, but the crack next to it was good.  Later on that pitch, you finally work you\\'re way into a good right facing dihedral with some good stemming moves and a small section where I moved out onto the face for easier climbing.  The moves weren\\'t hard here, but smearing stems always seem a little unsecure to me, have fun.  Somehow, we combined pitches 3 and 4 in the guidebook together and ended pitch 3 on top of a large ledge in the ridge.  The ledge is big enough that you can untie, get a good view of the crowds on the Petit and have a snack.    P4. Pitch 4 starts up a wide crack, but I hung out on the face for most this, because I think offwidths are about as fun as getting beaten with a rubber hose.  The climbing is a lot easier on these last two pitches.  Also, the route is completely obvious here as well.  The 4th pitch ends on another, somewhat smaller ledge.  More people on the Petit...if only they knew what they were missing over here.  P5. On the 5th pitch, there was little more loose rock and hollow holds, so be a little more cautious.  From the top of #5, it\\'s a very simple scramble to the summit.  Ok, I was roped up, so what?  But honestly, it\\'s probably class 2 to the top from here.  The top has a great view of the surrounding area.  Also, a little less comforting, look down through the boulders on the summit on the west side.  I swear I saw daylight through there.  Anyway, head southeast from the summit and down a little gully to rap rings.  There are 3 50-60 meter raps to the top of the Gash here.  The rap rings looked pretty good.  Don\\'t forget to bring a second rope or you\\'ll be downclimbing.  Also, there seems to be a lot of loose rock that gets knocked down when you toss your ropes on each rappel so be prepared to shout \"ROCK!!\" often to the people below and watch for more of it when you pull your ropes.  That\\'s it.  Down the Gash to the trail.  Hope you enjoy it.  Also, I gave this a grade III, because it took us 13 hours, but we took a 2 mile detour by going to the south side first and then backtracking around to the north side.  It\\'s probably somewhere between a II and a III.  ',\n",
       " '\"An enjoyable romp up the obvious South prow of the tower\" (Gillett) with lots of option climbing (a la Gill).  You can dial up and down the difficulty up this alpine rock between 5.7 and 5.11.  This felt more mountaineering-ish due to the many rests/ledges.  Due to the wandering nature of the route, a camera seemed underutilized.    Approach:  Approach via Loch Vale, Sky Pond, to the base of the Petit Grepon (allow 2-2 1/4h).  From here, angle left and up around a 300 foot-high rock buttress (left and higher than the base of the Petit).  Scramble 3rd class (with sections you don\\'t want to fall) towards the base of the SW face (shady).  Stay left of this last 100 foot buttress and find a ledge system.  Allow 30-40 minutes for this last bit.  Description:  There are probably nearly infinite variations to this route.  We tried to aim for the prow and generally take the path of least resistance with a few detours.  I\\'ll describe one possibility, our path.  There is lots of rocks on ledges.  It was a 4 1/2 hour climb for slugs like us.    P1.  We geared up on the left side of a fading, slightly-sloping ledge system.  To the left, there was a previously-climbed crack in a dihedral system angling left (away from the prow).  Instead, we traversed perhaps 45 feet right to a big flake with a wide crack on its left side.  Face climb up to a crack and ledge system.  Move right perhaps 20 feet to a chimney-like system.  Continue up and right to a big ledge system in the sun.  This is the only pitch in the shade.  5.7, 195 feet.  P2.  We angled up and right (rather than traversing to the prow).  Follow a big groove via face holds.  Pass a set of 3 precariously-balanced rocks on the left, stand on the top of these rocks, move right and continue up to a ledge system 100 feet up.  You could continue up this groove, but the holds seemed less positive here, so I traversed right to a ledge on the prow.  5.7, 110 feet.  P3.  From here, pop up and on to the prow on excellent rock.  Continue up past short walls, angling slightly right.  We aimed for a good-sized, rightward-pointing flake.  Find a 5.8 move here.  Move up easier terrain to another big ledge.  5.8, 195 feet.  P4.  Here there are certainly more challenging options.  A sling above entices up on to more challenging ground.  Seeking a path of least resistance, we traversed right around the prow and found a wonderful dihedral system just right of the prow.  You can continue up and stretch it to a nice ledge.  5.7, 200+ feet.  There are nice views down of the Petit Grepon and Penknife summits.    P5.  Here you are again enticed onto more challenging terrain on the left up the bulging prow.  We angled right to an obvious notch.  There is a stretch of fractured rock just below the notch.  Protect this judiciously.  Rope drag prompted a short pitch.  5.7, 100 feet.  There is a fixed HB quadcam up here.    P6.  You can traverse the slab to the right, or down-scramble the ramp into the East gully system.  It appears you can make the top but not so quickly.  Find an anchor somewhere.  4th or 5.2, 190 feet.    P7.  You can take a direct line to the top 5.6? or we traversed left to the prow again.  Nice exposure on your left.  We found 2 fixed pitons and then the top.  5.4, 150 feet.  The shark in the summit register seems to be gone!  Descent:  From the South end of the summit area, find a 3 pin rap (one is blue) station just a few feet below the top.  Rap down the East Gully 180 feet to a big slung flake with an old piton (you pass this on your 2nd to last pitch).  You can rap and down-scramble this last bit if you have 50m ropes.  The 2nd anchor, described by Rossiter, 100 feet right via a grassy traverse (that we used previously), did not seem to be there.  Rap 195 feet, passing 2 less-confidence-inspiring rap stations, to a rap station with a piton, chockstone, a Wild Country Rock on the right.  A much shorter rap gets you to The Gash.  A marmot, however, easily scrambled up to this last rap station and continued upward.  Gillett describes doing this descent with 1 rope.  I would recommend 2 ropes, ideally 60m.  From here, scramble down to the boulder field, to a cliff.  Either find a grassy ramp system E->W (or descend the snow slot) past this cliff.  Pass another large boulder field and connect with the Andrews Glacier trail.  Allow 2-3 hours to descend.',\n",

Follow moderate cracks up and left towards the obvious hand crack in the steep face above.  Climb the steep hand crack as it goes up, cuts right, and goes up again (classic 5.9+).  Continue in the crack as it traverses horizontally right around the ar\\xc3\\xaate to a prominent right-facing dihedral (fun 5.8+).  Climb the dihedral for about 20 feet (5.8) and then traverse left to a large sloping belay ledge below The Tooth flake (bring small nuts and cams for the belay).  Pitch 2, 160 feet: Climb the left side of The Tooth flake to a stance on top.  Climb over a bulge and traverse up and left (thin 5.10a face).  Climb a steep section past The Bushes (5.9+) to a pleasant finger crack above.  Traverse up and left across a well featured face under a vertical wall with a crack.  Traverse left, stemming down and left (with your feet just inches above a roof) then pull over the bulge (nice 5.10a).  Work up and left to a belay.

Stop on a commodious ledge just left of the prominent pillar, 5.7.   2) Climb towards the wide crack on the left side of the pillar, traversing left on some intermittent jug rails for 15 or so feet. Head up past a series of shallow, right-facing corners with minimal gear (for about 20 feet) until it is possible to go left around the corner to some better gear. Make some committing moves to a good horizontal which is level with the top of the wide crack and traverse right to belay on a good foot ledge with small gear about 10 feet right of the large, left-facing dihedral, 5.10 R, 90 feet.  3) Step right and climb a very steep handcrack in the right wall of the dihedral, exiting onto the top of the prominent pillar. From the top of the pillar, traverse 25 feet left or so, place some small gear, and launch up the right of two major, left-facing dihedrals past several fun boulder problems separated by good rests. Belay where the dihedral turns into a ledge, 5.11- (5.9R), 160 feet.  4) Step right and up to the next ledge system, then cut back left making sure to place some gear on the traverse because the next section is a little exciting. Locate a shallow, left-facing corner, climb it and the incipient seams above it to the ledge below the great orange headwall, 5.10+ R, 80 feet.  5) There are two cracks in the headwall that almost touch down the the ledge. Climb the right hand of these two (it starts about 20 feet left of the pillar on the right side of the headwall). Follow the crack until it pinches off (about 35 feet up in some lighter color rock). At this point, step right and enjoy more fantastic crack and face climbing to a fifteen foot section of chossy chimney and the summit, 5.10+, 150 feet.  To descend, do not rap off the block on the summit with the tat on it. It moves rather easily and is a testament to someone's rashness. Downclimb about 20ft on the northeast side of the spire to a two nut anchor, rap 35 meters to a grassy ledge with another two nut anchor. From here a 30m rappel leads to some grassy ledges.

A few single pitch routes can be found at the Lakeside Wall (found in the Gillett and Rossiter RMNP books) and make for a good alternative if committing to something bigger further up canyon becomes unsavory due to weather or otherwise.

       " 'Likely due to the fact that just up the valley one finds classic climbing on the Cathedral Wall and Cathedral Spires, this large 1200 foot North face feature has seen very little documented activity by rock climbers (two high end mixed routes have been done in the winter). The wall is characterized by two distinct rock types separated by a large ledge system at 450 feet. Below the ledge system is super high quality, slabby granite marked by sparse crack systems and seams.  This stone reminded me of the granite I enjoyed on a recent Sierra trip, albeit less splitter and much lower angle. Above the ledge system, the stone turns into your typical Hallett flavor of gneiss. While the lower granite face consists of gear protected slab climbing, the upper portion of the wall gets steeper, is highly featured (like Hallett), and has several intermittent crack systems. The majority of the rock climbing up here will be on the more moderate side of things.  Portions of the wall seep throughout the summer, but for having seen little to no action from climbers, the rock is remarkably clean on both the upper and lower sections of the face. Although identified here simply as the \"North Face\", it actually has more of a Northwest aspect and sees sun hit the lower slabs around noon in late August.',\n",
       " 'This route is shockingly clean for having never seen traffic (that we know of).  Josh and I finished up high grinning ear to ear for having stumbled onto so much good, clean climbing. The route clocks in at approximately 1150 feet and has two distinctly different flavors of climbing. Due to incoming weather, for the last 3 pitches we simul-climbed to the ridge left of obvious terrain that would continue at a moderate but more consistent level of climbing to a higher exit. Like Hallett, there are any number of ways to go up there on mostly homogenous terrain.  P1. Identify a minor gully to the left of which is an obvious, right-facing corner with black rock on its right face. There is a good photo on the Upper Wall mixed route page of this feature where the black portion is a sheet of ice (center of photo, climber at the base). About 40 feet to the right across the minor gully, you will notice twin seams that meander up a clean, granite slab towards a \\xc2\\x93nose\\xc2\\x94 at the top of the granite. Head up these seams for 150 feet, and belay at the base of the \\xc2\\x93nose\\xc2\\x94 on a #1, 2, 3 Camalot combo. A nut tool in the leaders hand will help clean up some additional gear placements, 5.8 PG-13, 150 feet.  P2. Head straight up and left off the belay and place some #0.4 - #0.75 Camalot gear in a shallow crack about 20 feet off the belay. From here, either head straight up the seam (5.8 PG-13) and find pro as you go, or at an easier but more runout grade (5.7 R), climb the featured, wavy slab to the left that is next to a closed corner system. After about 25 feet, there is a perfect #2 Camalot in the corner. From here, head up and right to an obvious, large, grassy ledge. Use a combo of #0.2 - 0.5 Camalot sizes for the belay, 5.7R or 5.8 PG-13, 100 feet.  P3. Head left then straight up, weaving through the breaks in the roofs/overlaps, eventually coming to a left-facing hands to fingers, left-facing corner. After 20 feet, you will be below the final roof. Surmount this, and belay from slung boulders on the large terrace, 5.8, 70m/230 foot stretcher. You could break this into 2 pitches.    *Terrace break - move the belay up and left to the right-facing corner 20 feet LEFT of the obvious, large, seeping, right-facing corner. This is almost part of the large right facing, seeping corner and is characterized by dual, right-facing finger and hand/fist cracks. Straight up from this dihedral is an obvious horn/finger of rock sticking out from the wall. The wall becomes steeper than the previous 3 pitches here and changes to gneiss.** P4. Head up the dual finger/fist crack dihedral on steeper terrain towards the horn/finger of rock about 120 feet up. Just below the horn/finger, cut left and head up towards a great, grassy ledge and belay off of small stoppers and a yellow Mastercam-sized piece. This pitch could be broken into 2 pitches with good belays. As we did it, it was 5.8, 180 feet.    P5-7. It appears that the ridge is just overhead from this belay, but there is about 500 feet of moderate climbing left. Head straight up off the belay, staying away from the gully to the left and going up and right where appropriate. One could probably head up and right off of the belay and stay on more interesting terrain with intermittent gear. There are available belays if you pitch it out, but you will have to seek them out, 5.7 with an occasional harder move, 500 feet.\\nWalk East down the ridge. There is a possible descent down the  Northeast Gully with a little bit of down scrambling or a potential rappel. The Rossiter 2015 guidebook has good photos of this feature. I believe there is a cairn marking the top of the gully.   Otherwise do as we did and continue down the ridge and attempt to identify East Gully (also described in the Rossiter 2015 book). This will be a mellow gully with a short section of 3rd class then a brief talus slope back to the lake. If, while approaching, you headed around the east side of the Loch to access the south shore/talus slope, then consider dropping bags and racking up here to avoid walking back to the base of the climb.',\n",

This rock may have been climbed previously, but no obvious evidence of prior climbing was visible on the prominent prow, the line that calls to the heart of the moderate explorer who may be sitting with his/her kids looking for bighorn sheep at the Sheep Lakes pullout.

Continue up more-alpine terrain to small saddle of sorts about 80 feet up.  (You can exit off right to hiking terrain here).  Here you can (recommended) move left onto a flake and gain a crack at a small overlap, follow the fun crack until it ends, & then climb a delightful face to a ledge & belay.

The right side is the classic Blitzen Ridge. 5.4 to 5.7?  The center of the cirque, the Y Couloirs are reserved for the alpinists. These couloirs hold the remote RMNP alpine experience.   Descent for all Ypsilon routes- either run down the backside to the trail head on Fall River Road (provided it's open). 2nd choice, descend Donner Ridge, or into the cirque between Ypsilon and Chiquita and back to Ypsilon Lake.\",\n",
       " 'The prospect of climbing the Blitzen Face is like so many other walls when viewed from in front: a ridiculous and preposterous undertaking. So often these faces appear too steep and intimidating to juxtapose them with the thought of actually climbing them. However, once close upon the face, lines of weakness marking the possibility of climbing reveal themselves. The goal then should be to force yourself to go and touch the base of the wall before listening to the voices that would otherwise turn you around in your tracks and head you back in the direction from whence you came.  The Blitzen Face is not so different. From afar, it looks imposing; even overhanging at its base, with an upper section that rears vertical and sustained as well. Not so; close upon the base and the climber will find a path of weaknesses leading through several small overhangs, and a much lower angle, broken upper face. However be warned; this route, as with most to be found on Mt. Yipsilon, is comprised of very loose rock. Some of us don\\xc2\\x92t mind a little choss mixed in with our climbing though, and this is a worthy mountain to climb.  Approach as for any climb on the east face of Mt. Yipsilon; see the description of the Prancer Ridge for a good account of how to navigate up to and around Spectacle Lakes. Remember to stay higher up on the side of the mountain and not lower around the shore of the lake for your traverse into the routes. Even in late summer, there is still a fair amount of snow present on the ground. A pair of crampons and an ice axe will not be unwelcome. On August 11, 2006, I climbed over 60 meters of steep, icy snow to reach the start of the rock. Look for a small island of stone that is on the right side of the lower Y-Couloir as a good place to start the technical climbing. The Rossiter guide describes the Blitzen Face as climbing two or three steeper pitches up a buttress on the right side of the Y-Couloir. From there, continue up a lower-angle face to an intersection with the Blitzen Ridge, just moments beneath the summit. Starting from the rock island at the bottom of the couloir, climb over broken terrain, up through several small overhangs. If you stick directly with the crest of the buttress, you should run into a couple of pitons on what might pass for the 2nd pitch or so. If the climbing does not suit your fancy, simply go right or left a few meters and find another path; all roads lead to the same ending. After a few pitches of navigating up the buttress, lower-angled terrain will be encountered. Climb this, aiming for the pinnacle of rock where the ridge, coming in on your right, meets the top of the face. The summit is only a short distance away at this point.  There are many options for getting down. On the occasions where I have climbed Yipsilon, I always have traversed the summit plateau to the south, and headed down a scree slope into a valley that is on the south side of the Donner Ridge, and from there back down to the valley that was used on the approach to Spectacle Lakes. This is pretty easy to navigate through, though complex in description. So, just follow your nose.  The Blitzen Face is a great climb. However, this is only my opinion. There is a lot of loose rock present, and the face is in a very remote setting. Expect a long day. See Rossiter\\xc2\\x92s guide to the high peaks of Rocky Mountain National Park as a guide. Enjoy. ',\n",
       " \"Thanks to its beautiful rock and wild position in a wilderness setting, Blitzen Ridge is perhaps the best ridge climb in the Park.  Don't be fooled by the 5.4 rating. When planning for this route, keep in mind that you'll be climbing a rather commiting, lightning prone ridge which is blind to approaching storms.  Soloists in good alpine shape should find themselves on top of Ypsilon by late morning. Roped parties must take extra care to move fast and efficiently.  If sending the whole shpeal in a day, you'll want an early start out of the Lawn Lake trail head. Hike to Ypsilon Lake, and head NW on a small trail leading to Spectacle Lakes. When arriving in the cirque you'll want to avoid Spectacle Lakes by cutting right and straight up a talus hill to the start of Blitzen Ridge.  Head NW and the rounded hill will slowly narrow into a sidewalk of granite. From here, you'll be able to see how Blitzen curves up and to the left reaching Ypsilon's summit.   The cruxes of Blitzen Ridge are the Four Aces. You won't hit the peaks of all the Aces but rather to the right or left. For the first two Aces, climb on their left side to get around them. Climb straight up the third, and to the right on the fourth (which felt like the crux to me). From this awesome position, continue straight up a prow for 200ft.   Here the ridge eases to 3rd and 4th class but with outstanding exposure to your left. Run up this 1000 ft ridge trying to stay left for the best rock and best view.   A neglected super classic!\",\n",
       " \"Prancer Ridge ascends a ridge on the left hand side of the cirque formed by the east face of Mount Yipsilon.  It is entirely separate from the Donner Ridge but finishes in the same spot.  Approach as for Spectacle Lakes.  After getting to Yipsilon Lake, go all the way down to the lake and cross a bridge.  Immediately after the bridge, find a faint trail that goes uphill, following the inlet stream to Yipsilon Lake.  The trail stays mostly on the north side of the inlet stream.  After about a quarter of a mile, look for a stream coming in from the north that cascades down a very steep gully.  It is just after the trail crosses a small wooden bridge.  Cairns give some idea of which way the trail goes up the gully.  By picking a way carefully and weaving around any obstacles, it is easier than it looks.  The reward is the splendor of Spectacle Lakes.  These are truly a hidden jewel.  Fortunately, it takes a lot of work to get there.  It keeps the riff raff down.  Work around the Spectacle Lakes on the left or south side.  At first, detour high around a cliff that blocks the beginning of the first lake.  The rest of the way around both lakes is pretty easy.  There are 2 ways to approach the start of the ridge that forms the left hand side of the cirque formed by the east face of Mount Yipsilon.  The 1st and most direct is to climb straight up the snowfield at the back of the second lake up to the point where the Y Couloirs branch off in separate directions.  The ridge immediately to the left of the left hand branch of the Y-Couloir is the objective.  This requires climbing a long snowfield, even into August.  Some technical rock may be exposed about halfway up the snow field. A much saner option, especially if you are inclined to climb mostly on rock, is to approach from the left and angle up to the beginning of the ridge from the 2nd lake.  The angle of the traverse will be obvious as you work your way around the lakes.  Just look for a series of grassy ledges leading up and to the left, terminating just below the start of the ridge.  Once established on the ridge, begin climbing up and to the left, generally keeping with the crest of the ridge.  Weave left at first to surmount a small roof, but in general, stick with the path of least objectionable rock.  It is pretty gross in places.  Don't blink or you will miss the crux.  Come to think of it, I can't remember where this route is 5.6 at all.  Overall, it makes for a neat day of scrambling, if you are inclined to do so.  This route isn't recommended necessarily as a roped, technical climb, but it probably would make a dandy of a winter route, if you could get to it. Climb the ridge line to its top.  This is the junction of Donner Ridge and the summit plateau of Mount Yipsilon.  The true summit is just a short scramble to the north or climber's right.  For a quick descent, turn left, or south and carefully descend the south face of Mount Yipsilon.  It isn't very technical, just long.  At the bottom of the cirque, turn left or east and work your way back to Yipsilon Lake. Don't forget to look for the fixed technical Friend.  It's reassuring to know you are actually on a route.  Even though this climb gets 1 star, it is an awesome day out in a remote wilderness setting where you will probably not run into any other people above tree line and very little evidence of people having traveled before you.  Cheers.  \",\n",
       " \"This is one of the most spectacular ski descents in RMNP.  Although this is a climbing site and many people think of the Y couloirs as snow/ice/mixed climbs, the left Y Couloir (climber's left, skier's right) is most remarkable as a ski mountaineering adventure.  Typically the best time to catch this East-facing couloir is in the early morning, in the early spring. One can either approach from the Lawn Lake trailhead (below), or from the Alpine Visitor Center (above).  The complete tour, starting from Trail Ridge Road/Alpine Visitor Center and coming out at the Lawn Lake Trailhead is an awesome ski mountaineering experience; however, it is dependent on the opening of TR road.  The approach from below is straightforward and allows one to assess the conditions before dropping in on skis.    A single alpine axe and crampons should suffice for ascending the couloir.  Many climbers may feel comfortable without a rope.  With many miles, a lot of vertical, high summits, insane exposure, and wicked skiing, this is a very big day under the best circumstances.\",\n",
       " 'This is one of the classic snow climbs of Colorado.  In early season, there is generally a huge cornice at the top of this route.  It is safest to wait until it falls down (which often seems to be around July 4th).  Hence this route is in best condition later than most snow routes, early July through August.  You can bivy below the couloir or start early and blast in a day.  From the Spectacle Lakes, head up easy snow and branch right at the Y (the Left Branch I consider a separate route).  This lower section is not that steep, and we did it unroped.  Soon the right branch enters a nasty chimney filled with dripping water.  Before you get too far back into it, look for the 5.4 rock exit on the left.  Rope up and do two leads up the left wall (some loose rock) to a nice grassy ledge above the top of the chimney.  Traverse right on this ledge back into the Couloir.  The upper section steepens to about 55 degrees.  Romp up this to the final cornice/headwall.  If training for Alaska, you can attempt to tackle the headwall directly.  When we did this it was 80 degree snow wallowing, and we backed down.  We bypassed the headwall on the right (via some rock).  According to Rossiter, you can also exit left via a gully.  Descend south to Chapin Pass if you have a car there, or drop down the south face into the drainage between Ypsilon and Chiquita and follow this down to Ypsilon Lake.',\n",

It has often been described as the hardest high mountain in Colorado, largely due to an imposing summit block that requires technical climbing.  It has also been described as the longest approach hike to a 100 foot rock climb in the state.  The large summit block has several routes to the top;  all are 5th class and even the most experienced climbers will want a belay due to the looseness of the rock.  Route finding difficulties, weather, technical pitches and altitude make Dallas a serious undertaking.',\n",
       " 'The standard East Face route up Dallas actually starts on the South Face and winds its way around the lower mountain to the right.  A very explicit route description is available in Gerry Roach\\'s \"Colorado Thirteeners\" book.  Highly recommended is the variation Roach calls \"Stan\\'s Shortcut\".  Bushwack through the woods following Mill Creek and pass the beautiful waterfall on the right (east) side.  Many parties take the shortcut on the way up and follow the trail variation on the way down.  A two day backpack/climb is also possible.  Gain access to the South Face of Dallas where the fun really begins.  Follow the path of least resistance up the face and aim for a gully on the west side which allows access to the upper part of the face.  You will pass a strange ramp that looks like a killer ski jump.  Once through the gully trend towards the right and uphill between two cliff bands, one above you and one below.  This talus slope has the potential to be a real ankle breaker.  The faint path through this area will lead you over a shoulder and eventually into the East Face.  Follow the light (very light) climbers trail into the East Face gully system.  Look for the path of least resistance to gain elevation up the East Face.  You will be aiming for the East Ridge.  Near the top of the gully a short 4th class face climb gains access to the upper part of the face.  Less experienced climbers may need a belay here, and anchors are sparse.  We used three knifeblade pitons only partially driven.  A deep and often snow filled couloir tops out on the crest of the East Ridge and gives access to the North Face.  If snow conditions allow you can escape this couloir under a very large chock stone.  Another option is to stay right and gain the North Face through a blocky groove (class 4).  Some of our party needed a belay here also.    Once on the North Face proper, follow the ledges up and down to an obvious break in the summit tower.  This line is technical and very, very loose.  The first moves are the most interesting: up a crack and stepping across to another crack.  One should take the time to lean out and look down the North Face at this point; the view is extremely exposed and very dramatic.  Continue up the obvious easy route being careful not to knock stuff down on your belayer.  The rest of the route is easy moves between blocky ledges.  Be advised that it is very difficult to rappel this route or throw a rope down successfully.  Parties with more than two on a rope should consider having the seconds self belay or use a tag line for each second.  The wonderful and exposed summit is very loose and belay anchors are not very evident.  To descend from the top, find the large block on the northeast side of the summit tower.  This block can be slung (25 feet of sling material requried) for a spectacular free rappel.  This rap is one of the finest in Colorado for pure alpine beauty and breathtaking exposure.  One 50 meter rope is sufficient but two are better; this allows you to rap all the way past the big chockstone.  One 60 meter rope won\\'t reach.  EDIT:  The comments below indicate that one 60 meter rope is sufficient.  LS  Slog down the rest of the route the same way you came up.',\n",

Belay the second up or continue up. To your left will be a blank face, and to your right you will see a broken dihedral. Note: below and to the right is actually the Standard Route (5.3) to the summit, so if you wanted to you could bail and follow that use route to the summit.  From the platform, move up flakes that angle towards chimney (don't pull on these too hard) and pull under an awkward but fun overhang into the dihedral proper. Bomber bro ensues until you make last under a roof. Through a solid hand jam and pull yourself over it till you are eye level with the summit block. Place a small cam in horizontal and roll yourself over loose talus onto the summit block.  Build anchor from the summitblock anchors around large, table-shaped rock.

       " 'This is the very obvious, skinny couloir that threads up through the very center of Dallas\\'s South face.  Depending on your viewpoint, part of the couloir is obscured behind the prominent cliff face which forms the upper right half of the South face.    The route starts at a rockband parallel to the bottom of the huge cliff face on the right.  This can be climbed directly at low fifth-class or skirted on the left on snow.  The angle decreases slightly as the couloir passes right behind the cliff face, before steepening again.  The several cliffbands above are climbed through on short stretches of vertical waterice, AI3/3+.  At the final cliffband, trend right to the slot between the huge \"thumb\" on the skyline and the main summit.  It looks as if a direct finish is possible from this point by climbing handcracks straight up solid granite for 100\\' to ledges below the summit.  A preferred finish if you brought enough rock gear.  Otherwise, climb through the notch, down a little ways on the other side and back up and left to the East ridge.  Several variations exist; the easiest in the snow conditions we encountered brought us through a tiny hole behind a chockstone, 4th Class.  The final 100-150\\' from ledges on the East ridge to the summit is vertical and the only spot we used the rope.

Apparently, at least 2 rock climbs, Texas Wheelchair Massacre and Lightline, have been done.\",\n",
       " 'The Darkline is essentially a variation to the Lightline, which is the prominent ar\\xc3\\xaate on the Eastern (right) edge of the Ruby Wall. The Darkline follows a prominent chimney system which splits the wall just right of the Lightline ar\\xc3\\xaate and is currently (June \\xc2\\x9208) the hardest route on the wall. Climb up the first part of the Lightline for about 3-400 feet until you encounter the first steep section of climbing. Look right for the big, steep chimney and belay near the base of this. Make sure to put the belay off to the side of the chimney  to avoid the possibility of dislodging a rock onto your belayer. The chimney is wild, steep and 5.8, allowing great stemming and limited protection. Exit the chimney and continue up cracked slabs towards the stepped rock formation above. Another pitch climbs these steps via a prominent crack and corner system about 50 feet right of the Lightline ar\\xc3\\xaate. There are three steps to surmount on this pitch and each gets progressively harder. There is adequate protection on each step, but all are short overhangs above a slab, so a fall still may put one onto the slab below. As with much of the climbing here, it is alpine in nature and there is some loose rock. Be cautious. The final, third step is around 5.9, maybe even 9+ and awkward.  Above this, the climbing gets much easier as you head back left towards the top of the Lightline. Follow the Lightline to its end and descend as for Lightline and Texas Wheelchair Massacre. To reach this descent, you must hike to where the Lightline ar\\xc3\\xaate meets with the forested slopes above, then traverse right across the drainage until you can scramble down towards the area above the rappel trees. It is a little tricky to find from above so make sure you scope it out from below. You can get a good look at it while climbing either the Lightline or Darkline. The bolted anchors are somewhat tricky to find. There are numerous, crappy anchors about on the wall from the ice climb that forms up here (FYI: Abraxas NOT Blue Condition) in the winter. The gully where the ice climb would form up is often running with water in the summer making a good point of reference for finding the rappel line. ',\n",
       " \"Light Line is the prominent arete/buttress rising above the Engineer Pass pulloff parking area.  When the sun is out, it's very easy to spot.  This route first started out as a free soloing exploration, but I ran out of time and had to go pick my son up from school.  I returned shortly with Jeff Skolada and we climbed the buttress roping up for two pitches in the steeper middle section.  From the parking area, walk up the Engineer Pass road about 300' to the first drainage gully.  Ascend this to just past the base of the buttress, maybe by about 100' to a staging area to begin you climb.  If you're lazy and have 4WD, you can park at the second pullout on the Engineer Pass road and a shave a couple minutes off of your already short approach.  You can leave a pack at the base as you'll be descending this way in most cases.  Look up the gully and towards a small buttress on the right side.  This is where you will be descending.  In general, you'll be following the buttress to the top with minor wandering from side to side to avoid difficulties and looseness. The first 400'-500' of climbing head up the buttress with occasional steep sections.  This is the loosest part of the route, so take care, but the climbing is not difficult - maybe one or two spots of up to 5.5.  Once the wall steepens, it might be a good time to rope up if you haven't already.  Expect about 300 feet of 5.5 and 5.6 climbing that is exposed. Be careful in choosing your route to avoid loose rock.  If you're leading, expect it to be runout.  Just before you crest the steep section is the routes technical crux.  It's a rock-over move stepping over a small roof onto a slab.  Once you've reached a small ledge above the steep headwall, the difficulties ease and there is less loose rock to be found.  Expect another 500' or so of to reach the top of the ridge.  There's one spot in particular moving left from the right side of the ridge with trees, that you'll want to be careful on.  Once on the summit, take note of the descent.  You'll be able to look over toward it.  You'll be rapping of a tree at a low point to the top of a buttress, and then down a dihedral into the top of the gully you've hiked up.  Descend the summit ridge to the right, down a hill of dirt and into the drainage that forms the upper portion of the ascent gully.  Look for faint trails through here.  There's no need to go bushwhacking.  Where you cross the creek/drainage, you should be on a deer trail.  follow this across the drainage, and across the hillside.  You'll want to drop down into an open area before cresting the next ridge.  On one of the lower pine trees are anchor slings.  Note, I've seen rap slings on a tree further down and right, don't use these.  The first rap finish down the hillside over a little step onto the top of the buttress with a tree on it.  The second rap follows the dihedral toward the gully and look for anchors on the wall of the dihedral at the 100' mark.  Watch your rope ends.  The third rap heads down the slap and onto a steeper wall.  There's an inverted V-notch slightly (climbers) right of the fall line with the next anchor.  If for some reason this area is icy (like a winter ascent for example) there's another anchor further right that's harder to get to.  The next rap lands you in the gully.  Hike down the gully and you'll encounter two drop offs.  You can either downclimb these, or rappel.  The first step has bolted anchors (skier's) right, or you can downclimb (skiers)left.  The second step you can rap off some old mining relics (skiers) right, or downclimb (skier's) right. The rest is just a walk down the talus in the gully to your car.    Note: it is possible to hike off to the right along the big ledge system past an old mine and then down to the Engineer Pass Road.  I would recommend it as it's loose and rough going.\",\n",

Working around the towers before the summit of the spire is fun and exposed.  We rapped into the notch and got socked in by a nasty thunderstorm.  It didn't relent so we had to bail down the horrendously loose gully below.  We were able to downclimb all but the final 150ft, which we rapped (anchors should still be there).

       " \"This route is a stunning venture into the spirit of San Juan alpine climbing. With a backdrop of views that will have even the most sunset-seasoned climber digging butterflies out of his stomach, this route features extremely solid quartzite, exquisite sections of splitter finger and handcracks, respectable runouts, chimney shimmies, a few roof jigs, and more than a few tantalizing, yet committing, moves.    From where the north face surges upwards from the talus, six technical pitches will bring a climbing team to the upper slopes of the peak. Each pitch is like a different climb. Original, creative, and flirtatious, each one has its own distinct crux and flair.  From the last technical pitch, 500-700 feet of simul-climbing through 3rd, 4th, and low 5th class rock reaches the summit ridge.   Pitch 1: this is severely shortened by rope drag. Climb into the corner located about 75-100 meters east of the colossal couloir that splits the north face. An exposed, and possibly wet, move pulls out above a roof and into an excellent finger crack in a dihedral. (5.8)  Pitch 2: follow the dihedral, then move right onto the buttress for some exposed and runout routefinding. Upon reaching a grassy ledge, traverse left (beneath a band of rotten rock) and find a nice lawn to belay from. Beware rope drag. At the point where the traverse begins, it is possible, and tempting, to move right. That dihedral looks ravishing, but was wet when we passed by (5.9+).  Pitch 3: a few bouldery moves in a corner with an superb fingercrack brings you to a chimney. Despite the excitement, remind yourself Santa isn't coming, and continue. Stir you sauce and enjoy! This is an absolute CLASSIC pitch! Belay on a huge flake on the right side of the dihedral. It is an excellent position, despite the stack of rubble sharing the ledge just to the left (5.9).  Pitch 4: routefind upwards, the line is more or less direct.... Belay somewhere above on a little ledge towards the left. (5.8?).  Pitch 5: move back out onto the face to the right, and enjoy the buttress until it funnels you into a small corner adjacent to the main dihedral to the left. This little corner has a bomber, fractured fingercrack. It will be tempting to move right out of this corner on a horizontal rail, but whoa pardner, cool your heels. Continue left to a what is a veritable golf course perched serenely on the precipice. Around the corner to the right isn't quite as good as the allure it exudes. Belay from the corner; rope drag from where you would belay on the golf course is worse than a bear with allergies (5.9).  Pitch 6: !!!this pitch! It is one of the most flustering and goofy set of moves I have found in Colorado alpine. So, depending on your disposition, you will want to as well. Move directly out of the corner above the golf course. Pull through a few powerful moves on a small roof and good holds and punch into a larger roof above. A wild, swinging move will toss you from beneath the roof and back into the dihedral.  From there, find a good belay and cruise (5.10-).  Simul-climb....  NOTES:  -We did this with a 70m rope; however, pitches were shortened more by rope drag and lack of gear. A 60m will suffice.  -The rock is phenomenal; however, there is the inevitable, occasional loose rock.  -The cruxes on pitch six can be circumnavigated by following a nice hand crack flake into the dihedral. It is essentially a campus move, and because the rock was wet, we opted out of that course of action.  -We had doubles up to 1 and 1.5 sets of nuts. Doubles up to 2 or even 3 would not be missed.  -Bad weather, or lack thereof, will greatly alter the psychological crux of the slick, sloping, sloppy, lichened quartzite runouts.   -Between the long route, delicate routefinding, and tedious descent, this is a long day, perhaps more.\",\n",

Aim for this friendly fellow, and set up a belay on the ledge below (800' low-mid 5th and maybe a bit harder in spots).  Climb the short, wide, 5.8 hand crack that zig-zags up the face. After that, there's more low-mid-5th, a twenty foot 5.6 face with Gunksy edging, and then more low-mid-5th. That'll take you to a vertical corner with a wide crack on the right and a hand crack on the left. Climb this, then continue up the 5.8 finger crack above (500' 5.3 to 5.8).

All offer great multi-pitch alpine rock climbs in a beautiful wilderness setting.  There is lots of first ascent potential!',\n",
       " 'This is a route deep in the heart of the San Juan Mountains, the East Grenadiers.  The route ascends on the left of a large, right-facing dihedral on the West side of the North Face of The Silex.  The first four pitches skirt the left of the dihedral and offer perfectly solid, near vertical, 5.8, quartzite climbing.  The crux is dealing with the massive runouts.  The quartzite is solid but offers few options in places for gear.  Some sections offer almost no protection with twenty feet between near worthless placements.  Pitch two and pitch four are the X-rated, 5.8 crux pitches with consecutive twenty foot runouts over marginal pieces (small nuts), though the belay stations are bomber (some other pitches require some creative anchor building).  Overall, the climb keeps the heart pumping for the leader.  This is a really incredible area to climb.  Try not to bail, you will probably end up leaving more gear than you can afford, since there did not seem to be very many natural anchors on the lower half of the route.  FYI: there is another route in this photo put up by Rex Wolters and Jon Kelly that \"follows the arete/buttress to the right of the large dihedral on the western side of the north face\", 1500\\', IV 5.10 A1 (AAJ).',\n",
       " \"This is the peak adjacent and west of Storm King above Trinity Lake. The only known route is on the North face above the lake, looker's left of the obvious, central gully system. If anyone has more information about routes of this peak, please feel free to share, and I will add/make changes to it.\",\n",
       " 'This one\\'s a real hair-raiser! As shown by the picture, the route roughly follows the path of least resistance up the rock rib just left of the central gully on the North Face. We found the crux to be in the 2nd pitch in a right-facing, bulging dihedral. Protection on the route can be sparse and takes some imagination at times. This route may be borderline X-rated. Belays are also tricky (welcome to quartzite climbing!), so bring your a-game. This is kind of a \"choose your own adventure\" route, and route finding can be a bit challenging at times. Have fun out there!',\n",
       " 'From Graystone to the Guardian, this is yet another of the fabulous Quartzite Peaks also known as The Grenadiers. As with all of the peaks of this sub-range, it is a pretty mountain, standing third from the end above the north fork of Trinity Creek. With Silex and the Guardian nearby, but more difficult to access, Storm King\\'s proximity to the northern terminus of the Needle sub-range accentuates its position in the San Juans. Indeed, the quad is named after this illustrious mountain. Additionally, it is blessed with a \"flower-strewn path of a route\" up an imposing, but nice, north face climbed by Bob Bliss in the \\'70s. By the way, this is one of the few north faces in the Rockies with only one route.... Its unnamed neighbor to the east, peak 13,405, also has a nice northern aspect waiting for first ascentionists. The walk up on the south side begins at the saddle with Peak Eight. It is well cairned. The southeast ridge, with initial climbing moves over a step, later has portions of scrambling over steepish sections. The northeast ridge was climbed by Mike Vanderbeek in the \\'90s, but information about it is lacking. During a Super-Alpine section of an XT 30-day C.O.B.S. course, Marcus Brown, with students, climbed the northwest ridge as well.',\n",
       " 'The north face is a dark, intimidating wall. Bob Bliss, however, in Rosebrough\\'s guide, describes a \"gentle flower-strewn-path-of-a-climb.\"  Rosebrough notes from personal correspondence with Bob: \"Climb 40 feet to a ramp. From the ramp, climb right (west) up 3rd and 4th class ledges and short chimneys and then 70 feet of broken rock to a formation he called \\'a bowl of tears.\\' At this point, climb up a steep, left-facing slab/dihedral and then 4 pitches up a chimney crack behind a great plate. Traverse 60 feet right (west) below the \\'plate glass\\' smooth slabs and then 90 up feet via a crack in a left-facing dihedral with a small overhang at the top (5.7). Three long pitches of 3rd and 4th lead to snow and then up left (east) to a \\'pass\\' climbing on dirt or mud. From here, 2 more easy pitches up broken blocks lead to the summit ridge.\"',\n",
       " \"Gain the broad ridge and climb a mix of easy 5th, 4th, and 3rd class for the first half of the climb.  The ridge narrows and route finding becomes more engaging to the base of the tower.  We climbed this feature in two steep pitches, the first being the crux of the route.  The position on top of the tower is excellent.  Make a wild and exposed move off the tower to regain the ridge.  From there it's mostly easy 5th with some steeper sections to the top.  There are many options on this fun climb choose your own adventure. \",\n",
       " \"This peak is one of the highest peaks in the Grenadiers near Silverton in the southwest part of the state.  It is also the location of the Wham Ridge, which is really the north face of the peak.  The rock is mostly solid, but there is still a lot of loose rock, mainly sitting on ledges.  Protection is also scarce, since most cracks are either seams or are filled with vegetation.  I used the #.5-2 Camalots I had many times, since passive pro was usually hard to place.  Although some of the climbing isn't super fun, the summit is awesome with views in all directions of the surrounding mountains.  The maps that cover the area are Snowdon Peak Quad for the first half of the approach, and Storm King Peak Quad for the rest of the approach and the actual mountain.\",\n",
       " 'Fun alpine climbing on Grenadier quartzite. Exposed, but you won\\'t find the climb to be difficult if you\\'re in climbing shape, have mountain experience, and come prepared to be in the mountains (this is still remote alpine climbing).  Instead of climbing the \"casual\" route, which is the true ridge line of Wham Ridge - i.e., sticking to the right-most ridge line (arete) - climb straight up the middle/center of the Wham face. Again, the climbing\\'s not difficult, but a little harder than the 5.3-5.4 along the ridge. Gerry Roach\\'s 13ers guide rates this a 5.7. If there\\'s 5.7, there\\'s not much.  Most of it seemed to be in the 5.3-5.5 range. We encountered two short 15-20\\' sections that were pushing 5.7, all of which were blocky and easy to protect. There are a couple of lines up the middle, though the steepness and rock type doesn\\'t change.  We simu-climbed most of it in approach shoes, pitched out two full rope lengths about 600\\' shy of the summit, and free-soloed the last 150-200\\'.  Carried climbing shoes, but never used them.      \"Center Shift\" is the name Roach uses in his 13ers guide.',\n",
